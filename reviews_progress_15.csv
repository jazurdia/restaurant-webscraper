The food here is next-level — beautifully presented and absolutely bursting with flavor.

I ordered the ceviche, and it was to die for. Fresh, vibrant, and perfectly balanced — easily one of the best I’ve ever had. The “trust latches” (the crispy fried bites served alongside) were equally amazing, a must-try combination. Every dish was plated with such care and creativity, making it not just a meal but an experience.

The atmosphere is warm, modern, and stylish — perfect for enjoying authentic Peruvian cuisine with a contemporary touch. On top of that, the service was outstanding. Our waiter, Louis, went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience. He was so attentive, helpful, and genuinely welcoming, which made the meal even more enjoyable.

If you’re in the area, I highly recommend stopping by Mission Ceviche. Whether you’re a fan of Peruvian food or trying it for the first time, this place will absolutely impress you. I’ll definitely be coming back!",,1043,2025-10-01T16:21:08.805Z,5 days ago,0,184,True,"Hey Robert,

The dishes tend to be sweet, but my mom felt it tasted too salty, so there’s definitely a cultural component to how you might perceive the food. When we arrived, it was starting to get busy (around ~5-5:30), so the workers started to set up a second location for dine in. My group of three ended up on one of the outside tables by this second location. I really appreciate Up Thai’s interior design so I was a little disappointed with not being able to show my family inside. Otherwise, dining outside went really smoothly. Servers paid thorough attention to customers outside, so I did not feel like we were lacking anything in comparison to sitting inside.

The flavors weren’t mind-blowing or life-changing, but everything was executed very well.

We got the mango avocado salad, the clay-pot fried rice, and the soft shell crab in red curry from the summer menu.

Our favorite was probably the mango avocado salad—it had a perfect level of spice and acidity to complement the rest of the meal. The clay pot fried rice was a bit underwhelming for me. Although the blend of different types of meat offered great textures, the flavor was uniform throughout the entire dish—everything tasted like sweet soy sauce or eel sauce.

The ambiance was excellent — elegant, modern, and very clean. The decoration felt refined and fancy, creating a welcoming yet upscale atmosphere.The food was truly the highlight of the evening. The tuna tartar was absolutely delicious, fresh and perfectly balanced. The octopus was tender and flavorful, while the salmon was simply outstanding. Every dish showed great attention to quality and preparation.The only disappointment was the limonada. It lacked the freshness and flavor expected and didn’t quite match the otherwise high standard of the menu.The service was attentive and friendly, making the experience even more enjoyable.While the restaurant was spotless and beautifully decorated, the bathroom did not live up to the same standard as the dining area. This is an area that could definitely be improved to better align with the restaurant’s overall image.
Despite a couple of small drawbacks, I left very happy with the food, the service, and the environment. I would definitely return for another meal and recommend it, especially for the outstanding dishes.",,1164,2025-09-02T23:48:22.640Z,a month ago,0,142,True,"Thank you so much for sharing your detailed and thoughtful review!

Quite an impressive memory I’d say.

I always sit at the bar when I come in , the seats are comfortable and the drinks are solid. They serve a Sancerre by the glass which I greatly appreciate and enjoy. The bartender Elif is excellent. She knew the food menu and made great suggestions.  I’m in the restaurant business and she cranked out service drinks to the busy tables all night and didn’t seem to break a sweat.

We came in for a quick dinner (couple with a young child). Our daughter was starting to act up after a long day of being out and about so we cut our order short realizing it was going to be a challenge having ordered some food for her and my wife in-advance already.

We ordered a main and a side and a glass of bubbly and the waiter visually and verbally got upset at us and shook his head and said ""really just two items"" and stormed away. Didn't realize there was was a minimum spend requirement and another couple beside us just ordered a burger to share and nothing else yet didn't receive this sort of treatment..

Absolutely unprofessional behavior from the bartender and maybe needs to be reminded that he's in the hospitality business. The place wasn't even that busy to begin with so it's not like we were hogging up valuable real estate.

Food was average - it's a neighborhood type feel with its own charm but definitely won't be coming back based on the bartenders disgraceful attitude.",,1044,2025-08-16T23:21:30.313Z,a month ago,0,483,True,,,

Not coming back.

We waited 45 minutes to over an hour for our food with zero updates. Halfway through, we were told they had run out of fries, which were supposed to be included with the meals. Instead of offering any kind of reasonable solution, we were given just two options: cancel or order the food without fries at the same price — no compensation, no apology.

We chose to replace the fries with vegetables (the only alternative available), only to find out they charged the vegetables as a paid extra — even though fries were included in the original dish. So we ended up paying more for less, simply because they didn’t have something essential on the menu.

We also ordered 2 medium burgers and 1 well done, but all came out medium rare. When we tried to address the issue, the responses were dismissive: “this is how it’s done here” or “for the future, this is a place where it takes forever.”

It’s fine if there are delays or issues, it happens. But tell your customers upfront, not when they’re already seated and committed. Also, making people feel like they can’t ask questions or express concerns is not okay.

If your restaurant often runs into these problems, at least show some accountability or basic customer care. Unfortunately, this experience was frustrating, overpriced, and poorly handled from start to finish.
We ended up paying 50$ per person for a beer in a can and a burger wrongly cooked, without fries and with the side dish we didn’t want.",,1539,2025-04-26T03:04:27.441Z,5 months ago,0,12,True,,,

The meatballs were just okay—small in size (six per order, good for sharing) with a sauce that tasted more onion-forward than I remember. Not bad, but not a standout.

The tables are too small and too close together. The chairs are uncomfortable. The room is so loud & crowded you can’t have a conversation. They refuse to bring you bread until after you order your entrée. The appetizers came in four minutes, proving that nothing was made to order. It tasted microwave hot. The oil used for frying was old and bitter. The waitstaff was kind of rude and impatient. The pasta sauce tasted like it was made with  cheap tomato paste. It had that cheap, bitter aftertaste. The duck was so tough that it wasn’t chewable. The menu does a terrible job describing the food that they bring you. Literally nothing about the experience was good or noteworthy.

We have both lived on the UES and had never been. So, we were thrilled when we got a reservation for 7:45 on a Saturday! We were greeted by a very friendly host and were seated immediately. Then we met our waitress…who couldn’t have been less friendly…
Her tone and demeanor towards us was unfriendly from the moment she came to take our drink order. Our food took over 40 minutes to come out and after we ordered our appetizers, she did not come to check on us once…while we saw her tending to other tables and saw other tables that arrived after us get their orders before we did, as well as multiple rounds of drinks. By the time our food finally came out, I was starved. It was clear they forgot about us and scrambled to get our food out quickly. The shrimp in my pasta were grey..clearly not fully cooked. My pasta was drastically under-seasoned. Our waitress, again, avoided us. Didn’t come over to ask if we were happy with our food. By the time we had finished eating what we could, we asked for the check before they had even cleared our plates. I don’t know what was going on and I can’t remember the last time I had a BAD meal in NYC…until today. I was beyond disappointed by UVA. A place I have been dying to try for years. It’s safe to say I’ll never be coming back and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.",,1405,2025-08-03T01:48:05.480Z,2 months ago,0,6,False,,,

Delicious, full of flavor and obviously using the correct ingredients as we did not feel drowsy afterwards (seems to be an issue with Italian places in our experience - maybe an issue California?).

What a disappointment!  The food is horrible.   The pasta is mushy and without flavor. The appetizers were inedible. The prices are inflated and the atmosphere combines stuffiness with arrogance.  On top of this, the servers were all rude and uncaring.  They all exude a feeling of superiority, while making sure that one feels unwelcome. No one even bothered to check on us, or ask why the meal sat uneaten on our table.
We finally left our uneaten food, paid the bill without discount and found another restaurant that understood customer service.
I am not one to complain about restaurants, but my advice on this one would be to avoid at all costs.",,721,2024-12-30T17:37:01.146Z,9 months ago,0,1,False,,,

I walked in on a cold evening because the place was empty and looked nice. The service? LOWSY! I ordered a drink that tasted like they don’t clean their soda fountain, I also asked a question about a certain dish, the server went to go “ask” and literally never came back to the table. I sat there maybe a total of 36 minutes just waiting with my gross drink, until I decided to leave, in a packed restaurant I would have more grace, in a dining room with only two other tables full? NOT. I went to the bar to pay for my gross drink only then did the waiter hurry over -because they probably thought I would leave without paying. (I’m not a heathen)  I paid and then they turned the device over and had the AUDACITY to ask if I wanted to tip!

We were looking for a British breakfast spot for our early Saturday morning before heading to the Met Museum, and John’s Wood was definitely on our radar.

We had done our homework beforehand, so we ordered right away.

First up was the Scotch Egg which was egg wrapped in sausage. It was a bit different from what I had in mind, especially the portion size. Overall, it was just okay.

We also tried the Fish Burger and Shepherd’s Pie. The Shepherd’s Pie was simple, authentic, and really enjoyable. The Fish Burger, however, was a bit bland for my taste.

Overall, it was a decent spot. I’d consider coming back to try their Fish & Chips, maybe next time!",,704,2025-07-06T22:11:18.842Z,3 months ago,0,146,True,"Hi Piboon,

It’s been a while since I’ve been back but decided to take a friend for dinner on a Friday night. The service was great but unfortunately the food has gone really down hill. Especially for the price.

The bread was cold and flavorless. On the chewy side.
The salad portion for two has decreased considerably for two. The mouruli salad is shredded lettuce and feta. Just a very small portion.

I ordered a glass of Sauvignon blanc and I’m pretty sure I was drinking Chardonnay.

The sea bass was a full fish for $42 which I would gladly pay because sea bass is delicious! However, we split it and the entire fish was maaaybe 4oz of meat so we each consumed less than 2oz of protein and it was not fluffy nor flavorful.

A manager came by and asked how everything was. So I told her I was disappointed with the fish and explained why. She did nothing which was surprising. I gave them a chance to offer something but it seems this is what they offer customers.

Just a very unenjoyable meal all around.

I feel terrible that I have to write this review but my hope is that they make the necessary changes so they can go back to being one of the best Greek restaurants in NYC. The atmosphere is the same, quite nice. Our server was excellent. The food however was unacceptable. As a Greek, I'm very familiar with our tastes. For starters, the tzatziki sauce was a bland spoonful of yogurt. Though I understand that some people don't like too much garlic, this had close to none. It also lacked the zing of acid which typically comes from a splash of vinegar. Completely tasteless and runny. The zucchini fritters (kolokithokeftedes) were almost completely black on the exterior which tells me that the oil they used to fry them should have been changed a long time before they fried these. The fried calamari was extremely rubbery. The one appetizer that was decent was the octopus. Last but not least, the bread that they started us off with was very stale. This is not the Yefsis I knew and once visited weekly :( Having said all this, because it was several years since I had been here, I looked at the reviews to make sure it was still what it used to be. This is why I was so surprised that the food came the way it came. The photos and the reviews written by others were very positive. Perhaps the chef who is spoken so highly of (I'm sure she must be wonderful) was absent on that Sunday evening?",,1452,2024-06-24T13:40:36.244Z,a year ago,0,256,True,,,

I was pleasantly surprised by the modern atmosphere without a bunch of Georgian ethnic decorations all over the place. The young and great looking staff in plain black looked very sheek, and the older bartender in white created a nice black and white contrast. No logos, no clutter, very clean. We both ordered khinkali, quick and straightforward.

The wait for the dumplings turned into a very long delay. When I asked about the status of order, the waiter told me they take a long time to steam and that the water needs to boil. To me, that is ridiculous. Any professional kitchen should have boiling water ready. Even at home I keep a thermos with boiling water for tea or soup. For a staple dish served all day, this made no sense.

The wait was so long that we ended up having multiple conversations and a bathroom visit for both of us!

I asked the hostess if they had any bread, since many restaurants do that. I felt that the Georgians who pride themselves on being the best host,  would embrace this opportunity. She flatly said no. It is not her job, but still, nobody checked in on us for a long time. Nobody even refilled our water. Later I called over another waiter, very nice young guy,  and he helped us pass time discussing tradition of bread, with explanations about how it is baked and pictures.

The bathroom was actually quite nice, especially for Manhattan, but with a random photograph of two parrots on the wall.
The wait dragged on. My dumplings came out at least ten minutes before my son’s. We usually eat together, so I waited. By the time his food came, my dumplings were predictably cold, and nothing was done about it even after i commented.

Weird: My plate had sour cream, and his plate had a little glass pepper shaker placed right on the plate. That was the most random thing because those shakers are usually sitting on the table next to the salt, not sitting next to your food, touching it.

The vegetarian mushroom dumplings were wonderful, but cold. I also want to note that the prices on the online menu $10 did not match what was presented at the restaurant 12.95.

Afterward they cleared our table completely, even whipped it, but did not bring the bill. Any restaurant knows the check should follow when the last plate leaves. Instead, we sat at an empty wiped table waiting even more, missing a beautiful sunset. I finally asked the redhead waitress for the check and told her it was annoying that my food came ten minutes before my son’s. For a small party of two, entrees should arrive together and hot.

That is when the real fun began. In my attempt to leave after 1+hr, the opposite happened. I was surrounded by the bartender on one side and the redhead on the other, standing within two feet of me. They insisted the meal would be on them and refused to let me leave unsatisfied. The bartender kept saying ""i take the blame"" even though he never serviced our table,  and switched to speaking Russian, which I did not appreciate in the context of today’s politics. I felt insulted by the switch in language during all of this, as if I had any difficulty explaining myself in English (I do not,  I assure you).

I found it ironic, since earlier we had discussed how free food can be considered insulting in Georgian tradition. Our entire intention was just a quick fifteen minute in and out for a couple of appetizers turned into more than an hour boredom and cold food. My bill was small. I insisted on paying, and it turned into another long back and forth. I even told them I would leave a bad review (hey,  I never said I wouldn't even if they did)  if they did not let me pay.

And in the middle of all that back and forth, I missed the sunset. Totally wasted evening.  we already ate at the jazz club,  but even after all this waiting,  I was ironically starting to feel very hungry again.
I came full,  and left hungry.",,4067,2025-08-19T01:21:28.941Z,a month ago,0,166,True,"Dear Anna,

We weren’t planning on a big dinner, just a quick taste of the place.
We ordered khinkali dumplings, expecting them to arrive fairly quickly. Instead, we waited. And waited. When my mom and I both asked what was taking so long, but I am used to everything taking longer in Georgian culture.

The wait stretched on long enough that we started running out of patience. My mom asked the hostess if anything like bread was available while we waited.  the restaurant was far from packed. Eventually we waived for another server to stop at our table,  finally

When the dumplings finally started to come, they didn’t arrive together. My mom’s plate showed up first, and mine didn’t come until about 10-15 minutes later. She tried to wait for me, but by the time my food came out, hers had cooled off. This food can't be consumed cold,  the cold dough turns into chewey rubber.

What I received was three dumplings and, oddly, a small glass pepper shaker resting right on the plate next to the food. Not on the table, but literally on the dish itself. It looked random. My mom’s dumplings came with sour cream, which at least made sense.

The lamb dumplings tasted good.

When we finished, the servers cleared the table completely but then left us sitting with nothing. No check appeared. We ended up just staring at an empty table, waiting, while the sun was setting outside. Watching that moment slip away was frustrating. Eventually my mom had to go over and ask for the bill herself, and she mentioned to the server how frustrating it was that the plates hadn’t been timed together and having yo wait for the check

At that point we just wanted to pay and leave, but instead things took an even stranger turn. All of a sudden, the bartender randomly appeared and one of the servers positioned themselves on either side of my mom, like blocking her.  This turned into an uncomfortable back and forth.

The whole thing dragged on far longer than it should have. the staff went in circles. Then, to make things worse, they switched to speaking Russian while addressing my mom.
Very long and strange experience.

This friday it seemed appropriate to have a closer look. Made the reservation, signed and sealed. I walk in a gesture to the host, reservation. He escorts me to my table. I sit down as though I am some sort of highly respected food critic (one day). He comes over shortly after with a menu, another man drops off a bottle of water.

Eventually I order, I might add at this point that the service throughout my meal had seemed merely transactional, no words were exchanged above what was absolutely necessary. Something that doesn’t necessarily bother me, but something to note. Perhaps it is a Georgian attitude, I know my Armenian grandmother can come off like this at time - that point is related to the extent Georgians and Armenians are similar, which I am not sure. I digress. I order Soko Ketze and the Chakapuli, to be accompanied by a glass of red georgian Kvevri wine. The Soko Ketze was underwhelming, and i partly blame myself in choosing poorly among the options, but it was essentially white button mushrooms that were only slightly cooked and didn’t appear to have much seasoning, then melted georgian cheese on top, the cheese was good but seemed haphazardly put together, both of which sat in a pool of butter. The Chakapuli was great, tender lamb bits nestled amongst some great punchy herbs of tarragon, parsley, mint, and i’m sure others. bread was good too and the wine i very much enjoyed.

Other notes: really cool interior and chinaware.

Would come back to try other dishes.",,1592,2025-08-10T03:12:54.569Z,a month ago,0,21,True,"Ethan, thank you for sharing such a detailed review.

We’ve been to nine other Georgian restaurants and bakeries around the U.S. — and Oda House is the best we’ve had so far!

The quality of the Khinkali (lamb soup dumplings) was much better than others we’ve had. The Khachpuri was incredible (iykyk that Imeruli is even better tasting than the IG trend egg boat Adjaruli) — a pro tip is to help balance the heaviness with their pickles side and ask for ajika (a peppery sauce that is great - it’s not on the menu but should be!). The only thing that could have made the meal even more perfect would be to have Churchkhela available to-go!

Thanks to the team for a special meal and while there are quite a few other Georgian places in NYC, definitely go here and you won’t regret it!",,813,2025-07-19T03:38:32.323Z,2 months ago,0,11,True,"Zach, thank you for your wonderful review!

stopped there the other day for well deserved hydration break on our 27 miles walk. Busy yet fast service, helpful staff. Good amount of options.
