    "review_text": "I had such an incredible dining experience at Mission Ceviche! The food here is next-level — beautifully presented and absolutely bursting with flavor.\n\nI ordered the ceviche, and it was to die for. Fresh, vibrant, and perfectly balanced — easily one of the best I’ve ever had. The “trust latches” (the crispy fried bites served alongside) were equally amazing, a must-try combination. Every dish was plated with such care and creativity, making it not just a meal but an experience.\n\nThe atmosphere is warm, modern, and stylish — perfect for enjoying authentic Peruvian cuisine with a contemporary touch. On top of that, the service was outstanding. Our waiter, Louis, went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience. He was so attentive, helpful, and genuinely welcoming, which made the meal even more enjoyable.\n\nIf you’re in the area, I highly recommend stopping by Mission Ceviche. Whether you’re a fan of Peruvian food or trying it for the first time, this place will absolutely impress you. I’ll definitely be coming back!",

    "review_text": "I ordered three dishes for the table, including the Clay Pot rice, Pad Thai, and steamed mussels. Every dish was a hit. My favorite was the clay pot rice, a definite must have!!\n\nThe dishes tend to be sweet, but my mom felt it tasted too salty, so there’s definitely a cultural component to how you might perceive the food. When we arrived, it was starting to get busy (around ~5-5:30), so the workers started to set up a second location for dine in. My group of three ended up on one of the outside tables by this second location. I really appreciate Up Thai’s interior design so I was a little disappointed with not being able to show my family inside. Otherwise, dining outside went really smoothly. Servers paid thorough attention to customers outside, so I did not feel like we were lacking anything in comparison to sitting inside. In fact, one of the waiters reminded my family that Clay Pot rice was best enjoyed mixed, so they are pretty attentive to detail.",

The flavors weren’t mind-blowing or life-changing, but everything was executed very well.\n\nWe got the mango avocado salad, the clay-pot fried rice, and the soft shell crab in red curry from the summer menu.\n\nOur favorite was probably the mango avocado salad—it had a perfect level of spice and acidity to complement the rest of the meal. The clay pot fried rice was a bit underwhelming for me. Although the blend of different types of meat offered great textures, the flavor was uniform throughout the entire dish—everything tasted like sweet soy sauce or eel sauce. The soft shell crab curry was great and tasted just as expected.",

The Greek salad was crisp, fresh, and seasoned just right.\nThe Branzino was excellent, flavorful, and somehow both light and filling at the same time.\n\nThe atmosphere is lively and inviting and the service is good\n\nI recommend Blue Mezze Bar (Zoi) and if you are lucky enough to have Okn take care of you, you are in for a fantastic experience.",

I made a reservation for four people at noon.     When we showed up for our reservation it was really raining hard.     They told me that my reservation was for outdoors and we could sit outside if we wanted.     Other than that, they would not honor our reservation.      In my 60 years of making reservations,  I have never had someone do that!  So very rude.   It’s a shame because the food is good.",

    "review_text": "I recently dined at this Mediterranean restaurant and had a wonderful overall experience.\nThe ambiance was excellent — elegant, modern, and very clean. The decoration felt refined and fancy, creating a welcoming yet upscale atmosphere.The food was truly the highlight of the evening. The tuna tartar was absolutely delicious, fresh and perfectly balanced. The octopus was tender and flavorful, while the salmon was simply outstanding. Every dish showed great attention to quality and preparation.The only disappointment was the limonada. It lacked the freshness and flavor expected and didn’t quite match the otherwise high standard of the menu.The service was attentive and friendly, making the experience even more enjoyable.While the restaurant was spotless and beautifully decorated, the bathroom did not live up to the same standard as the dining area. This is an area that could definitely be improved to better align with the restaurant’s overall image.\nDespite a couple of small drawbacks, I left very happy with the food, the service, and the environment. I would definitely return for another meal and recommend it, especially for the outstanding dishes.",

The hostess Veronica is awesome - my friend left his umbrella last time  and she saved it and remembered that I had called about it ! Quite an impressive memory I’d say.\n\nI always sit at the bar when I come in , the seats are comfortable and the drinks are solid. They serve a Sancerre by the glass which I greatly appreciate and enjoy. The bartender Elif is excellent. She knew the food menu and made great suggestions.  I’m in the restaurant business and she cranked out service drinks to the busy tables all night and didn’t seem to break a sweat.\n\nOverall it’s definitely worth giving a shot if you live in the area,  I am always more than willing to pay whatever it is if the quality is there - Blue Mezze Bar delivers.",

Our daughter was starting to act up after a long day of being out and about so we cut our order short realizing it was going to be a challenge having ordered some food for her and my wife in-advance already.\n\nWe ordered a main and a side and a glass of bubbly and the waiter visually and verbally got upset at us and shook his head and said \"really just two items\" and stormed away. Didn't realize there was was a minimum spend requirement and another couple beside us just ordered a burger to share and nothing else yet didn't receive this sort of treatment..\n\nAbsolutely unprofessional behavior from the bartender and maybe needs to be reminded that he's in the hospitality business. The place wasn't even that busy to begin with so it's not like we were hogging up valuable real estate.\n\nFood was average - it's a neighborhood type feel with its own charm but definitely won't be coming back based on the bartenders disgraceful attitude.",

    "review_text": "One of the most disappointing dining experiences we’ve ever had. Not coming back.\n\nWe waited 45 minutes to over an hour for our food with zero updates. Halfway through, we were told they had run out of fries, which were supposed to be included with the meals. Instead of offering any kind of reasonable solution, we were given just two options: cancel or order the food without fries at the same price — no compensation, no apology.\n\nWe chose to replace the fries with vegetables (the only alternative available), only to find out they charged the vegetables as a paid extra — even though fries were included in the original dish. So we ended up paying more for less, simply because they didn’t have something essential on the menu.\n\nWe also ordered 2 medium burgers and 1 well done, but all came out medium rare. When we tried to address the issue, the responses were dismissive: “this is how it’s done here” or “for the future, this is a place where it takes forever.”\n\nIt’s fine if there are delays or issues, it happens. But tell your customers upfront, not when they’re already seated and committed. Also, making people feel like they can’t ask questions or express concerns is not okay.\n\nIf your restaurant often runs into these problems, at least show some accountability or basic customer care. Unfortunately, this experience was frustrating, overpriced, and poorly handled from start to finish.\nWe ended up paying 50$ per person for a beer in a can and a burger wrongly cooked, without fries and with the side dish we didn’t want.",

He is so knowledgeable about the menu and it is apparent that he is passionate about this place. He really made us feel like an old friend. And the food is jaw-dropping. The mac and cheese? Oh. My. God. It’s spectacular. It's not just the best mac and cheese in NYC—it’s hands down the best I’ve ever had, anywhere. I ordered it with jalapeños and you certainly can’t go wrong with a little bit of spice and a whole lot of cheese! This is my favorite spot in the city. It’s unmatched on all levels and I can’t wait to return again and again and again!",

I can never come here without ordering the truffle gnocchi—it’s rich, flavorful, and honestly hard to beat anywhere else. The gorgonzola pear salad was light, refreshing, and very good. The meatballs were just okay—small in size (six per order, good for sharing) with a sauce that tasted more onion-forward than I remember. Not bad, but not a standout.\n\nService is consistently strong—the food came out quickly, our waitress was attentive, and the whole staff is always accommodating.

The oil used for frying was old and bitter. The waitstaff was kind of rude and impatient. The pasta sauce tasted like it was made with  cheap tomato paste. It had that cheap, bitter aftertaste. The duck was so tough that it wasn’t chewable. The menu does a terrible job describing the food that they bring you. Literally nothing about the experience was good or noteworthy.

    "review_text": "My friend and I were so excited to come to Uva for the first time on a Saturday night. We have both lived on the UES and had never been. So, we were thrilled when we got a reservation for 7:45 on a Saturday! We were greeted by a very friendly host and were seated immediately. Then we met our waitress…who couldn’t have been less friendly…\nHer tone and demeanor towards us was unfriendly from the moment she came to take our drink order. Our food took over 40 minutes to come out and after we ordered our appetizers, she did not come to check on us once…while we saw her tending to other tables and saw other tables that arrived after us get their orders before we did, as well as multiple rounds of drinks. By the time our food finally came out, I was starved. It was clear they forgot about us and scrambled to get our food out quickly. The shrimp in my pasta were grey..clearly not fully cooked. My pasta was drastically under-seasoned. Our waitress, again, avoided us. Didn’t come over to ask if we were happy with our food. By the time we had finished eating what we could, we asked for the check before they had even cleared our plates. I don’t know what was going on and I can’t remember the last time I had a BAD meal in NYC…until today. I was beyond disappointed by UVA. A place I have been dying to try for years. It’s safe to say I’ll never be coming back and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.",

    "review_text": "The last day of our New York stay we wanted to have real authentic Italian food after our Guggenheim visit.... yes, this place was featured at NHONY but to me that would not matter. Pappardelle and Gnocchi Ricotta were our main dishes after a delicious salad (Bianca) and polpettine. Delicious, full of flavor and obviously using the correct ingredients as we did not feel drowsy afterwards (seems to be an issue with Italian places in our experience - maybe an issue California?). Finished our meal with real gelato and a torta di mandorle (almond tart). Ambiance? The place is quite dark but luckily we were able to sit at the back patio which helped a LOT. Quiet and plenty of daylight, while still easily accessible for the staff. Great place.",

The pasta dishes never disappoint, but the standout is the ricotta gnocchi, served in a decadent black truffle and chive sauce--creamy, flavorful, and unforgettable. Another must-try is the melanzane alla parmigiana, a comforting eggplant parmesan reminiscent of lasagna, but lighter and just as satisfying. With its warm ambiance and top-notch food, UVA is the perfect spot for date nights and great vibes!",

Lots of specials to supplement the menu. Everything our group ordered was great including appetizers and desserts. Fair prices. Highly recommended if you're in the Upper East End.",

All of the food is amazing but I especially love the grouper and poached pear dessert. Their specials are also always fantastic. Thank you for being a little gem in our big city!",

    "review_text": "We were very excited to go to Lusardis, as we read positive reviews.  What a disappointment!  The food is horrible.   The pasta is mushy and without flavor. The appetizers were inedible. The prices are inflated and the atmosphere combines stuffiness with arrogance.  On top of this, the servers were all rude and uncaring.  They all exude a feeling of superiority, while making sure that one feels unwelcome. No one even bothered to check on us, or ask why the meal sat uneaten on our table.\nWe finally left our uneaten food, paid the bill without discount and found another restaurant that understood customer service.\nI am not one to complain about restaurants, but my advice on this one would be to avoid at all costs.",

This review is late but I went here a while back and as our food was served, a huge cockroach crawled out on the table by my pasta! Instead of the manager apologizing, he simply had the staff remove the dish and thought that would be enough to make up for the ‘issue’. He even said ‘this is NY’…essentially, what do you expect? We were flabbergasted. Needless to say, I will never return. Eat at your own risk…",

The Tiramisu was delightfully soft and creamy. Kudos for accommodating us during the busy Saturday night rush; however, booking in advance is highly recommended due to the bustling dinner hours.",

The service? LOWSY! I ordered a drink that tasted like they don’t clean their soda fountain, I also asked a question about a certain dish, the server went to go “ask” and literally never came back to the table. I sat there maybe a total of 36 minutes just waiting with my gross drink, until I decided to leave, in a packed restaurant I would have more grace, in a dining room with only two other tables full? NOT. I went to the bar to pay for my gross drink only then did the waiter hurry over -because they probably thought I would leave without paying. (I’m not a heathen)  I paid and then they turned the device over and had the AUDACITY to ask if I wanted to tip!\n(HERE’S A TIP: INSTEAD OF CHATTING WITH YOUR COWORKERS, TEND TO YOUR GUESTS!!!!)",

It was a bit different from what I had in mind, especially the portion size. Overall, it was just okay.\n\nWe also tried the Fish Burger and Shepherd’s Pie. The Shepherd’s Pie was simple, authentic, and really enjoyable. The Fish Burger, however, was a bit bland for my taste.\n\nOverall, it was a decent spot. I’d consider coming back to try their Fish & Chips, maybe next time!",

    "review_text": "I’ve been coming to Yefsi for years. It’s been a while since I’ve been back but decided to take a friend for dinner on a Friday night. The service was great but unfortunately the food has gone really down hill. Especially for the price.\n\nThe bread was cold and flavorless. On the chewy side.\nThe salad portion for two has decreased considerably for two. The mouruli salad is shredded lettuce and feta. Just a very small portion.\n\nI ordered a glass of Sauvignon blanc and I’m pretty sure I was drinking Chardonnay.\n\nThe sea bass was a full fish for $42 which I would gladly pay because sea bass is delicious! However, we split it and the entire fish was maaaybe 4oz of meat so we each consumed less than 2oz of protein and it was not fluffy nor flavorful.\n\nA manager came by and asked how everything was. So I told her I was disappointed with the fish and explained why. She did nothing which was surprising. I gave them a chance to offer something but it seems this is what they offer customers.\n\nJust a very unenjoyable meal all around.\n\nI miss the old Kanye I mean yefsi!",

In no time, I was sitting with Katerina, the chef, the owner and his wife. I felt like family…\n\nAn amazing place, this Yefsi Estiatorio. They don’t just feed you here—they totally take you in.",

    "review_text": "Came back several years later and I was disappointed. I feel terrible that I have to write this review but my hope is that they make the necessary changes so they can go back to being one of the best Greek restaurants in NYC. The atmosphere is the same, quite nice. Our server was excellent. The food however was unacceptable. As a Greek, I'm very familiar with our tastes. For starters, the tzatziki sauce was a bland spoonful of yogurt. Though I understand that some people don't like too much garlic, this had close to none. It also lacked the zing of acid which typically comes from a splash of vinegar. Completely tasteless and runny. The zucchini fritters (kolokithokeftedes) were almost completely black on the exterior which tells me that the oil they used to fry them should have been changed a long time before they fried these. The fried calamari was extremely rubbery. The one appetizer that was decent was the octopus. Last but not least, the bread that they started us off with was very stale. This is not the Yefsis I knew and once visited weekly :( Having said all this, because it was several years since I had been here, I looked at the reviews to make sure it was still what it used to be. This is why I was so surprised that the food came the way it came. The photos and the reviews written by others were very positive. Perhaps the chef who is spoken so highly of (I'm sure she must be wonderful) was absent on that Sunday evening?",

Each one feels family welcoming you in their home. Very hospitable, friendly, and knowledgeable to the dishes. Each can be an ambassador of the cuisine. They explained the dish well, including back story beyond its ingridients.\n\nWe really enjoyed!",

    "review_text": "We came after a Lincoln Center jazz concert with diner with the simple intention of grabbing a quick small appetizer just to experience this particular Georgian food location with 4.7 rating. I was pleasantly surprised by the modern atmosphere without a bunch of Georgian ethnic decorations all over the place. The young and great looking staff in plain black looked very sheek, and the older bartender in white created a nice black and white contrast. No logos, no clutter, very clean. We both ordered khinkali, quick and straightforward.\n\nThe wait for the dumplings turned into a very long delay. When I asked about the status of order, the waiter told me they take a long time to steam and that the water needs to boil. To me, that is ridiculous. Any professional kitchen should have boiling water ready. Even at home I keep a thermos with boiling water for tea or soup. For a staple dish served all day, this made no sense.\n\nThe wait was so long that we ended up having multiple conversations and a bathroom visit for both of us!\n\nI asked the hostess if they had any bread, since many restaurants do that. I felt that the Georgians who pride themselves on being the best host,  would embrace this opportunity. She flatly said no. It is not her job, but still, nobody checked in on us for a long time. Nobody even refilled our water. Later I called over another waiter, very nice young guy,  and he helped us pass time discussing tradition of bread, with explanations about how it is baked and pictures.\n\nThe bathroom was actually quite nice, especially for Manhattan, but with a random photograph of two parrots on the wall.\nThe wait dragged on. My dumplings came out at least ten minutes before my son’s. We usually eat together, so I waited. By the time his food came, my dumplings were predictably cold, and nothing was done about it even after i commented.\n\nWeird: My plate had sour cream, and his plate had a little glass pepper shaker placed right on the plate. That was the most random thing because those shakers are usually sitting on the table next to the salt, not sitting next to your food, touching it.\n\nThe vegetarian mushroom dumplings were wonderful, but cold. I also want to note that the prices on the online menu $10 did not match what was presented at the restaurant 12.95.\n\nAfterward they cleared our table completely, even whipped it, but did not bring the bill. Any restaurant knows the check should follow when the last plate leaves. Instead, we sat at an empty wiped table waiting even more, missing a beautiful sunset. I finally asked the redhead waitress for the check and told her it was annoying that my food came ten minutes before my son’s. For a small party of two, entrees should arrive together and hot.\n\nThat is when the real fun began. In my attempt to leave after 1+hr, the opposite happened. I was surrounded by the bartender on one side and the redhead on the other, standing within two feet of me. They insisted the meal would be on them and refused to let me leave unsatisfied. The bartender kept saying \"i take the blame\" even though he never serviced our table,  and switched to speaking Russian, which I did not appreciate in the context of today’s politics. I felt insulted by the switch in language during all of this, as if I had any difficulty explaining myself in English (I do not,  I assure you).\n\nI found it ironic, since earlier we had discussed how free food can be considered insulting in Georgian tradition. Our entire intention was just a quick fifteen minute in and out for a couple of appetizers turned into more than an hour boredom and cold food. My bill was small. I insisted on paying, and it turned into another long back and forth. I even told them I would leave a bad review (hey,  I never said I wouldn't even if they did)  if they did not let me pay.\n\nAnd in the middle of all that back and forth, I missed the sunset. Totally wasted evening.  we already ate at the jazz club,  but even after all this waiting,  I was ironically starting to feel very hungry again.\nI came full,  and left hungry.",

    "review_text": "My mom and I decided to stop at this Georgian restaurant for something light. We weren’t planning on a big dinner, just a quick taste of the place.\nWe ordered khinkali dumplings, expecting them to arrive fairly quickly. Instead, we waited. And waited. When my mom and I both asked what was taking so long, but I am used to everything taking longer in Georgian culture.\n\nThe wait stretched on long enough that we started running out of patience. My mom asked the hostess if anything like bread was available while we waited.  the restaurant was far from packed. Eventually we waived for another server to stop at our table,  finally\n\nWhen the dumplings finally started to come, they didn’t arrive together. My mom’s plate showed up first, and mine didn’t come until about 10-15 minutes later. She tried to wait for me, but by the time my food came out, hers had cooled off. This food can't be consumed cold,  the cold dough turns into chewey rubber.\n\nWhat I received was three dumplings and, oddly, a small glass pepper shaker resting right on the plate next to the food. Not on the table, but literally on the dish itself. It looked random. My mom’s dumplings came with sour cream, which at least made sense.\n\nThe lamb dumplings tasted good.\n\nWhen we finished, the servers cleared the table completely but then left us sitting with nothing. No check appeared. We ended up just staring at an empty table, waiting, while the sun was setting outside. Watching that moment slip away was frustrating. Eventually my mom had to go over and ask for the bill herself, and she mentioned to the server how frustrating it was that the plates hadn’t been timed together and having yo wait for the check\n\nAt that point we just wanted to pay and leave, but instead things took an even stranger turn. All of a sudden, the bartender randomly appeared and one of the servers positioned themselves on either side of my mom, like blocking her.  This turned into an uncomfortable back and forth.\n\nThe whole thing dragged on far longer than it should have. the staff went in circles. Then, to make things worse, they switched to speaking Russian while addressing my mom.\nVery long and strange experience.\nDo not recommend.",

    "review_text": "This little restaurant has caught my eye every time of the many times i have meandered by it. This friday it seemed appropriate to have a closer look. Made the reservation, signed and sealed. I walk in a gesture to the host, reservation. He escorts me to my table. I sit down as though I am some sort of highly respected food critic (one day). He comes over shortly after with a menu, another man drops off a bottle of water.\n\nEventually I order, I might add at this point that the service throughout my meal had seemed merely transactional, no words were exchanged above what was absolutely necessary. Something that doesn’t necessarily bother me, but something to note. Perhaps it is a Georgian attitude, I know my Armenian grandmother can come off like this at time - that point is related to the extent Georgians and Armenians are similar, which I am not sure. I digress. I order Soko Ketze and the Chakapuli, to be accompanied by a glass of red georgian Kvevri wine. The Soko Ketze was underwhelming, and i partly blame myself in choosing poorly among the options, but it was essentially white button mushrooms that were only slightly cooked and didn’t appear to have much seasoning, then melted georgian cheese on top, the cheese was good but seemed haphazardly put together, both of which sat in a pool of butter. The Chakapuli was great, tender lamb bits nestled amongst some great punchy herbs of tarragon, parsley, mint, and i’m sure others. bread was good too and the wine i very much enjoyed.\n\nOther notes: really cool interior and chinaware.\n\nWould come back to try other dishes.",

I ordered an ice tea- it tasted like a fun mocktail. We shared the Imeruli- which had a yummy crispy top with a gooey center. My boyfriend got the Lula Kebab with lamb and potatoes- the meat was juicy and the potatoes came with an amazing semi-sweet fresh tomato sauce. The service was perfect and the room felt romantic and warm. We regret not taking photos because it all looked so beautiful. Thank you to the staff for a great experience! We can’t wait to go back!",

We’ve been to nine other Georgian restaurants and bakeries around the U.S. — and Oda House is the best we’ve had so far!\n\nThe quality of the Khinkali (lamb soup dumplings) was much better than others we’ve had. The Khachpuri was incredible (iykyk that Imeruli is even better tasting than the IG trend egg boat Adjaruli) — a pro tip is to help balance the heaviness with their pickles side and ask for ajika (a peppery sauce that is great - it’s not on the menu but should be!). The only thing that could have made the meal even more perfect would be to have Churchkhela available to-go!\n\nThanks to the team for a special meal and while there are quite a few other Georgian places in NYC, definitely go here and you won’t regret it!",

The seafood salad was fresh, light, and bursting with flavor, and the cheesecake was pure perfection—creamy and unforgettable. Just as impressive was the service: warm, attentive, and genuinely friendly without ever being rushed. They made us feel right at home. Between the food, atmosphere, and outstanding service, Finestra is easily one of the best dining experiences in Manhattan. We can’t wait to come back!",

They were really kind (which should always be the case). One of the waitresses, Iris, was so kind she even gave me two macarons for assisting in the matter- and WOW they were incredible.

Note to management: go all the way french and use Malongo coffee !!!!\n\nstopped there the other day for well deserved hydration break on our 27 miles walk. Busy yet fast service, helpful staff. Good amount of options. Too bad they don’t have Malongo coffee, amazing coffee from south of France. I’d also add some desserts containing creme de marrons, a much better alternative compared to italian nutella. I love french food and I’m expecting french ingredients or french inspired ingredients in a french place. Oooo and add some picon and gambetta syrup if you can too. will definitely come back",

They are very nice and friendly and even allowed us to sample their new Fruity Pebbles shake. I ordered the Envy and my Fiancée got the temptation with Cajun fries. My oh my, the fries were not only seasoned to perfection but were a deep golden brown, and left a satisfying crunch after each and every bite. The burgers were also fantastic. I’m no expert, but the burger was fresh, perfectly seasoned, and tender. It was like biting into a pillow of greasy goodness. Nonetheless this place was a great place to cap off a great night.",

I went on Friday and it was hands-down one of the best burger experiences I’ve had in years. The meat was perfection—juicy, tender, and literally melted in my mouth. It was cooked to absolute perfection.\n\nOn top of the incredible food, the service made the whole experience even better. Nick, the staff member who helped me, was so pleasant, funny, and easy-going. He really added a personal touch that made the visit memorable.\n\nI can’t recommend this place enough. Sin City Burger is easily one of the best burger joints in NYC right now, and I’ll be telling everyone I know to stop by. A true gem!",

For the prices they charge I’m glad I haven’t visited in 20 years and will likely wait another 20+ years for the next visit.",

Katz should take note of this because that's what they're lacking...\nSinom finds the welcome average. Only one employee is there to welcome people. Sinom doesn't exist for others.\nPrice-wise, it's comparable to Katz.

Sandwich wasn’t horrible, a bit dry and had basic flavor but still edible (for $2 a bite of course) I just feel there shouldn’t be reviews or ravings of “known for huge sandwiches”. A huge sandwich should have me full or saving half for later. Im still hungry and Im definitely not a big back. I can appreciate great food for the price but this didn’t add up for me and I work all over the city to queens and brooklyn. Try it and form your own opinion of course but don’t go in with high expectations. I didn’t even have enough dressing to finish the other half of my sandwich.\n\nPs dont let the photo fool you, sandwich is barely 2 lbs Id say",

    "review_text_translated": "The staff is super friendly. I had a hard time with the food being too salty throughout my trip to the US, but the pizza here is less spicy and salty. I had the vegetable pizza and margherita pizza and they were so delicious!! The price was reasonable too. However, the seating is a bit cramped!! This is better than the pizza restaurants that appear in travel brochures!",

The attentive staff refills our water without asking, ensuring we stay hydrated throughout our meal. We particularly enjoyed the Tod Mun Goong, a dish of juicy and crispy shrimp cakes with ground pork. It was so delicious that we’ll definitely return just for that.\n\nAnother highlight was the Paloh Hang, a dish of tender meat served with a sweet sauce. It reminded us of Hamonado, a Filipino dish. We also tried the Zabb Hang, a dry rice noodle dish that we found more enjoyable than the Pad Thai.\n\nWhile the restaurant is very busy, especially during dinner, we recommend making reservations if you’re planning to dine with more than four people. Additionally, they only allow 90 minutes of dining, so be sure to plan accordingly.\n\nOverall, our experience at Paloh Hang was excellent and highly recommended.",

The basil cuts through rich beef perfectly, and when you throw it over rice with that runny egg on top, it’s just one of those dishes you don’t want to end.\n\nPlenty of good Thai spots in the city, but this one feels like it has some soul behind it. The Ka Prow Beef alone makes Tha Phraya worth putting on repeat.",

Its hard to find something this authentic and with really fresh ingredients presented so beautifully 😍 The servers are so thoughtful and kind with EXCELLENT service! We got the appetizer with the Beetle leaves...which honestly was SO good and fresh. Ive never had that before and I was blown away. We got the pomello salad and the sauce on this was delicious! We got a Phuket crab curry to share and asked for medium spice level. Turns out we underestimated our spice tolerance 😅😅. They're not messin around! But the curry was SO delicious we just kept eating and struggling. The server saw us and got us a sweet iced thai tea (without milk because I had expressed not wanting milk in my food earlier) without even asking!!! HOW INCREDIBLY thoughtful 😭\nWe got rose tea and one of the cocktails for drinks. Both were yummy. The star of the show was the mango sticky rice. This was certainly one of the best we've had in a long time!\nThis place is SO cute! Even their bathroom decor is supper cute lol. Would highly recommend!",

They have the staple dishes you'd expect to see from a US-based takeout spot, but their menu goes much deeper and has some true classic Thai dishes that are worth exploring. We ordered 3 entree / main dishes and two appetizers for our table of three people, and it was more than enough (and a fun variety). Their cocktail list is solid as well. It's a bit loud and the tables are a bit close together, but overall it's not bad and still a good vibe. Definitely snag a reservation if you can.",

We also had the morsillas that looked appealing but were bland , lacked flavor and were not savory at all, also a disappointment.  For the entree we were excited to order the signature paella, that people so rave about.  The paella was an interesting one , it was not super bad but also the flavors did not wow me , it did have great amount of fresh seafood but rice was lil too heavy .  Overall this place did not impress me at all . Definitely overrated, meals were mediocre with flavors that were completely off. Seasoning was not good!  👎🏽👎🏽\n\n—I had the ‘Tres Leche cake for dessert which was pretty good.",

We also had the morsillas that looked appealing but were bland , lacked flavor and were not savory at all, also a disappointment.  For the entree we were excited to order the signature paella, that people so rave about.  The paella was an interesting one , it was not super bad but also the flavors did not wow me , it did have great amount of fresh seafood but rice was lil too heavy .  Overall this place did not impress me at all . Definitely overrated, meals were mediocre with flavors that were completely off. Seasoning was not good!  👎🏽👎🏽\n\n—I had the ‘Tres Leche cake for dessert which was pretty good.",

We also had the morsillas that looked appealing but were bland , lacked flavor and were not savory at all, also a disappointment.  For the entree we were excited to order the signature paella, that people so rave about.  The paella was an interesting one , it was not super bad but also the flavors did not wow me , it did have great amount of fresh seafood but rice was lil too heavy .  Overall this place did not impress me at all . Definitely overrated, meals were mediocre with flavors that were completely off. Seasoning was not good!  👎🏽👎🏽\n\n—I had the ‘Tres Leche cake for dessert which was pretty good.",

    "review_text": "**Reseña: Buena Vista - Sabores que Resaltan y una que Otra Sorpresa (para el Paladar Boricua)**\n\n¡Saludos, gente de buen diente y paladar exigente! Recientemente me di la vuelta por Buena Vista y, como buenos puertorriqueños que somos, siempre andamos buscando esa chispa que nos haga decir \"¡epa, esto está brutal!\". Aquí les va mi veredicto, pensando en esos gustos que no se conforman con menos.\n\nEmpezamos fuerte con el **Pulpo a la Parrilla**, y déjenme decirles que este plato es un acierto. El pulpo estaba en su punto, tierno por dentro y con ese toque ahumado de la parrilla que tanto nos gusta. Una ejecución que respeta el producto y lo eleva.\n\nLuego le dimos la oportunidad al **Pork Chop** y al **Rib Eye**. Ambos cortes de carne estaban a la altura. El Pork Chop jugoso y con buen sabor, y el Rib Eye con esa grasa infiltrada que le da el gusto que esperamos. Si eres de los que disfrutan una buena carne, aquí no te vas a sentir defraudado.\n\nPero la verdadera estrella de los especiales fue el **Sea Bass Ceviche**. ¡Qué cosa más sabrosa! Fresco, con el balance perfecto de acidez y ese toque cítrico que te despierta el paladar. Definitivamente, este ceviche tiene el \"flow\" y el gusto que buscamos en un buen plato de mariscos.\n\nAhora, no todo fue color de rosa. Y es que, con la misma honestidad que alabamos lo bueno, tenemos que señalar lo que no cuadra. Las **Empanadas de Pollo** fueron el único plato que, honestamente, no nos gustó ni un poquito. Aquí hay que hacer un *mea culpa* y o las sacan del menú, o le dan un giro de 180 grados a la receta. No tienen ni la sazón ni la textura que esperaríamos; se sienten fuera de lugar en una cocina que, por lo demás, tiene platos tan bien logrados.\n\nEn resumen, [Nombre del Restaurante] tiene mucho potencial y platos que realmente valen la pena probar, especialmente si te inclinas por los mariscos y las carnes. Pero, por favor, ¡a revisar esas empanadas! Para los que tenemos un paladar educado y sabemos cuándo algo está bien hecho, hay opciones excelentes que demuestran que en esta cocina hay talento.",
    "review_text_translated": "**Review: Buena Vista - Flavors That Stand Out and a Surprise Here and There (for the Puerto Rican Palate)**\n\nGreetings, people with good taste and discerning palates! I recently stopped by Buena Vista and, like the good Puerto Ricans that we are, we're always looking for that spark that makes us say \"Wow, this is awesome!\" Here's my verdict, thinking about those tastes that don't settle for less.\n\nWe started strong with the **Grilled Octopus**, and let me tell you, this dish is a success. The octopus was cooked to perfection, tender on the inside, and with that smoky touch from the grill that we love so much. An execution that respects the product and elevates it.\n\nThen we gave the **Pork Chop** and the **Rib Eye** a try. Both cuts of meat were up to par. The Pork Chop was juicy and flavorful, and the Rib Eye had that infiltrated fat that gives it the taste we expect. If you're someone who enjoys good meat, you won't be disappointed here.\n\nBut the real star of the specials was the **Sea Bass Ceviche**. What a flavor! Fresh, with the perfect balance of acidity and that citrus touch that awakens your palate. This ceviche definitely has the flow and flavor we look for in a good seafood dish.\n\nNow, not everything was rosy. And, with the same honesty that we praise the good, we have to point out what doesn't fit. The **Chicken Empanadas** were the only dish that, honestly, we didn't like one bit. We have to make a *mea culpa* here, and either they take them off the menu or they give the recipe a complete 180-degree turn. They lack the seasoning or the texture we would expect; they feel out of place in a kitchen that otherwise boasts such well-made dishes.\n\nIn short, [Restaurant Name] has a lot of potential and dishes that are truly worth trying, especially if you're leaning toward seafood and meat. But please, check out those empanadas! For those of us with an educated palate and who know when something is well done, there are excellent options that demonstrate the talent in this kitchen.",

Ho pure trovato (purtroppo) un pelo nel mio piatto di Calzone alle fragole e crema. Trovo che sia ingiustificabile. Per quanto riguarda il personale l’ho trovato disponibile ma assente nell ambito di simpatia. Avevo alte aspettative e credo le abbia mantenute neutre. Non sarebbe il primo risolto da te che andrei a consigliare ad un amico ma comunque da provare se si vuole assaggiare un briciolo di culture italiana",
    "review_text_translated": "As a true Italian, I think this restaurant's cuisine still needs improvement, especially in the kitchen, where the ingredients aren't the best. I also (unfortunately) found my strawberry and cream calzone a little too salty. I find that unjustifiable. As for the staff, I found them helpful but lacking in friendliness. I had high expectations, and I think they kept them neutral. It wouldn't be the first one you've solved that I'd recommend to a friend, but it's definitely worth a try if you want to experience a taste of Italian culture.",

    "review_text": "Truly a gem. Whether you're in town for vacation or business, this place is a must. The food is simply delicious—classics with a special touch that makes each dish stand out. Quality food, amazing service, and ambiance without an ounce of pretentiousness. You must try the Insalata Gelato, lamb chops cooked to perfection, and the sea bass—absolutely delicious. But above all, the absolute must is the pistachio tiramisu dessert: airy, light, and with just the right amount of delicate sweetness.\n\nEvery member of the staff makes you feel cared for and welcome. The host and, I believe, co-owner Antonio (I was told he makes the pistachio dessert) is very kind, witty, and welcoming.\n\nTruly a gem in NY!",

Very intimate setting.\nWe got the calamari and carpaccio to share and both were delicious.\nI ordered the Cavatelli with eggplant and my friend got the chicken Parm. Each dish was better than the last. I will be back, whenever I'm in town.\nBack again one year later I've been thinking about the Cavatelli alla Norma- it was more delicious than I remember. Orecchiette with sausage was also divine.\nThis year, I came with my friends and seven month old. The manager was more than accommodating and friendly, kind. Great service again. I'll be back here again and again.",

It is one of my favorite types of pasta and was cooked perfectly. The sauce was rich in flavor with the right ratio of meat. I did try their signature red onion sherbet salad (yes, you read that correctly). The grilled shrimp in the salad was perfectly cooked. The salad was interesting as it is mixed table-side with the sherbet becoming the dressing     It could use a little more acid. And not sure if the blackberries are the right choice of fruit for it. I was warmly greeted as I entered the restaurant and the service was attentive but not obtrusive.",

My server apologized, but it definitely set the tone for the evening.\n\nI ordered a glass of wine and had to ask twice before it finally arrived. Then, when I chose not to order an appetizer, the server seemed frustrated and commented that “the food usually takes longer to cook, so most people get appetizers while they wait.” Ironically, my meal came out very quickly — so that interaction just felt unnecessary and a bit pushy.\n\nThe food itself was good, but the overall experience didn’t match the reputation. I left feeling more frustrated than satisfied, which was disappointing since I’d been having such a great night up until then.",

    "review_text": "TLDR: Stylish hotel restaurant with strong drinks and solid small plates. Great if you are staying at Arlo Midtown. Prices run a little high and portions lean smaller.\n\nArlo Midtown has a clean, modern vibe and the restaurant matches it. We stopped in for small plates and cocktails. The Red Hot Cloud was a standout drink. They pour over cotton candy melts into the drink and tastes as fun as it looks. Other cocktails were well made.\n\nFood was good across the board. The steak came with a bright, herby sauce and was cooked right. The smoked potatoes had a nice heat. The warm dinner roll with whipped butter was an awesome starter. Portions are on the smaller side, so it adds up fast.\n\nService was friendly and efficient. We were seated quickly and staff knew the menu. If you are staying at Arlo, it is a convenient, enjoyable choice. I would not cross town just for it, but I would happily eat here again while on property.\n\nPro tips\n• Order the Red Hot Cloud cocktail.\n• Share two or three plates per person.\n• If you want a cheaper meal, there are bodegas and quick bites within a short walk.",

The Altair five spice cocktail was somehow reminiscent of Apple cider to me though it was not included on the ingredient list. The gnocchi were out of this word, soft and flavorful. My friend had the sweet corn ravioli and she was kind enough to let me try one— as the waitresses warned it was a salty-sweet dish. It reminded me a bit of a pear ravioli I’d had in Florence though the flavor profile was completely different. The sweet corn ravioli had a brown butter taste to the filling that made you want to keep going back for another bite.",

The head bartender (David) is a master mixologist and made us 4 rounds of amazing and beautifully prepared cocktails. I think my favorites were the Roasted Apples and the Smoked Coffer with the desert course. Our server (Kira) was awesome and gave us a thorough review of the menu. The food was wonderful and we experienced all the elements. She was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. This was  a clear 5-star experience and recommend anyone in the Manhattan area spend a fabulous evening there. We will make this a regular stop every time we visit our daughter in NYC.

While I have my usual Thai restaurant go tos, Pure Thai is now my favorite when it comes to their noodle soups! I've just recently tried both their beef and roasted pork soups with rice noodles and they were so delicious and comforting! They also do their Thai iced tea just right and have good vegetable spring rolls! Service is warm and friendly even if they get so packed and busy. The restroom is spacious and clean especially in their expanded section which we usually enjoy better. Can't wait to come back soon for my Thai noodle soup fix! :)",

Some special dishes and drinks on the menu today so I tried the chicken seafood rice noodle stir-fry and have a glass chrysanthemum flower drink. Always friendly staff!\n\nStill my most favourite Thai restaurant to pop in for a quick lunch or group dinner. Love the noodle bowls the best!\n\nThey had daily specials at this time when we visited and it was beautifully cooked braised pork with spiced thin noodles with sauce. I also love the sugarcane ice cream! The staff is always attentive and friendly here 😊",

For Crab Curry, the curry sauce was very tasty, but it had just a small soft shell crab and it was difficult to find crab meat in the dish - I don’t think it’s worth the price. Gorlae seemed to be a popular appetizer, but I didn’t like it as the meat inside had an unpleasant taste for me.",

He had the Crab Curry, our friend the Kee Mao Seafood, while I had the Goong Karee. I ate all of my rice which I almost never do. And all of the dish of course. We sampled each other's dishes and all were just excellent (mine wasn't as spicy as theirs though, which was good for me). Didn't have room for desert as the portion sizes are more than enough to fill you up.\n\nI am very grateful we ended up picking Chalong and we'll definitely have to come back again.",

His was perfectly cooked in a delicious sauce, mine was an incredibly fresh Branzino, deboned (skin-on) with an addicting sweet and sour broth. Both came with reasonably well-cooked rice.

    "review_text": "My experience at this restaurant was genuinely so disappointing from start to finish. We arrived for our 7:30PM reservation and were told to wait outside for a few minutes while they prepped our table, only to wait outside for close to 30 minutes before we finally went back inside to remind them we were still waiting, sitting down around 8PM. Then, they refused to accommodate a member of our party who had an allium allergy - claiming that the chef only wishes to serve dishes authentically and not modify them - so our request to sub-in a simple soy sauce for the existing sauce in a noodle dish was denied. They went so far as to let us know that the manager said it was okay for us to bring in food from outside, at another restaurant, and eat it at the table, instead of trying to make a slightly modified dish to accommodate the allergy. Then to top it all off, they gave us a \"free\" appetizer during the meal to apologize for our wait. That would be great had we not gotten the bill and the \"free\" appetizer we didn't order was listed as a line item, $17, but they deducted a cheaper appetizer (costing $15) off our check instead. So in effect, we paid $2 for an appetizer we never asked for. Truly such a poor experience, and we had high hopes for the restaurant. Warning to all who have food allergies - do not expect the restaurant to do anything to try and help you.",

The skirt steak was chewy and the ceviche was a frozen seafood blend. The shrimp cockatiel was just ketchup and shrimp.\n\nWe waited over 20 minutes for our drinks, and this was before it even got busy. Once larger tables arrived, we were completely forgotten. Our waiter disappeared, and the busboy was the only one who actually tried to help.\n\nTo top it off, they added a gratuity charge for a group of just four people.

From the moment we sat down, we were interrupted every 20–30 minutes by someone—either the manager or a waitress—telling us how much time we had left. It felt like we were being pushed out the door before we even had the chance to enjoy our meal.\n\nInstead of relaxing and enjoying our food, we spent the evening feeling rushed and uncomfortable. Even when we were still eating, they came again to remind us that our time was almost up. It was very disrespectful and took away from what should have been a pleasant dining experience.\n\nIf a restaurant sets a time limit, that’s understandable—but constantly interrupting guests and making them feel unwelcome is not acceptable. Good service is about hospitality and respect, and unfortunately, that was completely missing here.",

I booked a party of 15 for a birthday celebration and the team was accommodating and responsive. For groups of 8 or more they offer a pre-fixe menu. The portions were generous, and we even took some food home. The salmon and steak were both excellent. Our servers did a wonderful job handling our (slightly needy!) group with patience and made sure the night was memorable.\n\nI’m giving 4 stars because I was expecting the same high-energy vibe as their Flatiron branch, and our table was all the way in the back. If you book a large group, I recommend requesting a table in the middle or closer to the DJ booth for a livelier experience. Overall, we had a great night!",

When we pressed her on why a reservation would be available on Resy, she denied that anything was available for 8:30 pm which was obviously a lie/attempt to evade. When we expressed surprise that no one had called us to discuss, she said that the automated email we received should have been enough.

I explained that the hostesses NEVER flagged to me that one shot couldn’t be sent. I am on a NYC budget, had I have been told it needed to be a full round I would have NEVER said yes.\n\nThe manager blamed me rather then his hostess who didn’t provide all info or a total amount and told me i’m too young to understand how these things work. He was extremely disrespectful, hanging up on me multiple times throughout the call and not listening to me explain what had occurred. I’m so in shock by how unprofessional he was.\n\nThankfully I can dispute this unauthorized charge. Next time he should tell his hostesses the rules to share with all customers rather then belittling me and telling me I should know better on how this works.\n\nHORRIBLE MANAGMENT",

I had the Korean wings and as a Korean foodie who has been to South Korea multiple times, I can tell you, this is as authentic Korean wings you can get from an American restaurant. Super delicious and authentic!\nI also had the roasted salmon dish. Also super good and didn’t leave any crumbs…like at all.\n\nNot to mention the staff is fabulous. I was welcomed by the restaurant manager, Uma who was super friendly and mentioned how he liked my name, something I rarely hear. We also had a short conversation about the meaning of my name. Then I had the absolute honor of being served by Mahayla. Her energy was infectious in the most beautiful way, not to mention very funny.\n\nIf yall are ever choosing between places to go to, definitely go to this one for good food & good vibes all around!",

Staff was very rude about it and actively hostile.\n\nI had eaten here before and would not recommend further to the mediocre food and terrible staff.\n\nThe whole situation would’ve been alleviated if they just put our name on the list while we were already waiting.

She sat us down and picked up the glasses with such hate like she was  irritated dealing with us. We ordered a sparkling water and waited for like 20 mins and nothing. She didn’t bother coming over to take our order. My boyfriend ended paying for the sparkling water and we decided to leave. The only good thing that came out of this is that someone turned in my phone that I had left behind in frustration of the service we received at this restaurant. This young lady does not need to work in the restaurant business with that type of attitude. I wish I got her name and we should have spoken to the GM of the restaurant. She lost a good tip from this customer. Will never return to this place and I will advise others not to go either.",

The contrast is pretty clear: the Mexican side is always lively and nearly full, while the Greek side tends to sit quiet and empty.\n\nWe went for the Mexican food, and it did not disappoint. Every dish was flavorful, well-prepared, and had that authentic touch that makes you want to come back. The team running the place is warm, welcoming, and genuinely friendly, which adds a lot to the experience.\n\nWhile the Greek side might not get much love, the Mexican kitchen is clearly the star here. Definitely worth a visit if you’re in the mood for great Mexican flavors in a casual, bustling atmosphere.",

    "review_text": "Stylish Setting, Uneven Execution\n\nNizuc in Hudson Yards sets the stage with a modern-Mexican aesthetic—sleek lines, an ample bar buzzing with happy-hour energy, and a menu that promises elevated takes on familiar fare. Unfortunately, what lands at the table doesn’t always match the promise.\n\nWe began with guacamole and roasted salsa macha alongside tortilla chips. The chips were plentiful, but the guac felt skimpy for the price. The ceviche, served in a coconut milk base, leaned watery and lacked the bright acidity and balance that typically make the dish shine. It felt heavy rather than refreshing, which was disappointing for a starter meant to whet the appetite.\n\nMains were a mixed bag. The steak arrived aggressively over-seasoned, while both chicken and shrimp fajitas lacked seasoning altogether, leaving them flat. The accompanying tortillas were far too oily, and the chicken mole was simply serviceable without any standout complexity. At $270 for four, the bill aligned with Hudson Yards expectations but didn’t feel justified for the quality.\n\nService, while polite, was inconsistent—water refills required reminders, the server had to repeatedly check back with the kitchen about dishes, and plates were cleared too eagerly, creating an undercurrent of being rushed toward the check.\n\nNizuc nails the ambiance and delivers on style, but for now, it feels more like a spot for cocktails and scene than for a meal worth savoring.\n\n#HudsonYardsDining #ModernMexican #NYCFoodReview #NotQuiteWorthIt",

I was diagnosed with cancer last year and before my surgery, my wife and I came here to have one amazing meal before i went into the major surgery. The manager, Stephanie, sensed that we were there for something and asked us. We shared my cancer journey and she was so kind, attentive, and caring—she told us to come back once I was in remission. A year later, I made it to remission and my wife called Stephanie to tell her the incredible news and that we would love to do a dinner for our family to celebrate at Nizuc. Even though she wasnt working that day, the entire staff, managers, EVERYONE celebrated us and gave us the true dinner of our lives. In such a sad journey, Nizuc lightened up our lives and we are so grateful that there are people like Stephanie and the staff who can make an impact like this. We will always remember this and will be back often!",

When I first arrived, I was told I could not sit outside because it was “only for dinner,” without even asking if I would be dining or not. Two different staff members received me without any manners, which already gave me a bad impression.\n\nAfter finally being seated, a third staff member came over and rudely told me I was sitting in the wrong place. I explained that I was placed there by their own team, but instead of handling the situation politely, she spoke to me from a distance and made me move myself to another table. I had to carry the menu on my own and relocate without any assistance.\n\nOnly later did another staff member arrive who was finally helpful and attentive unfortunately, this was after the whole negative experience.\n\nThe food itself was excellent, but the service was absolutely below the standard I would expect from a restaurant of this level. Management really needs to train the staff in basic hospitality and courtesy.",

    "review_text": "Wow! I’ve tried a few other Mexican restaurants in Manhattan recently, but this one is still my favorite!\n\nI ordered the shrimp taco and fish taco again—just like last time. If you can’t eat too much, I’d especially recommend the shrimp taco—it’s absolutely delicious!😋\n\nToday was even more fun because it happened to be Tuesday. When I got to the door, I realized they have Taco Tuesday deals:\n•\tA ribeye taco (with a slice of thin steak) for just $5\n•\tA shrimp taco for $4.50—cheaper than some food trucks!\nAnd the best part? They’re super tasty!\n\n(Regular price for beef tacos is $20 for two, so Tuesday is half-price!)\n\nThe dessert tiramizuc is homemade and also amazing, and the atmosphere is great. Draft beer, cocktails, and guacamole are all worth trying. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟\n\nTip: On Tuesdays, you need to sit at the bar or high-top tables to get the half-price deal!",

The space is stunning: lush greenery, artful details, and music that sets the perfect mood without being too loud.\n\nThe menu is a celebration of bold, modern Mexican flavors. From the creamy guacamole with house-made chips to the slow-braised birria tacos, everything tasted fresh and carefully crafted. I also loved how the dishes were served ,presentation was beautiful but not overdone.\n\nThe drinks were just as memorable. Their signature cocktails blend mezcal, tequila, and tropical flavors in unexpected ways . I had a passion caliente that I’m still dreaming about.\n\nAnd honestly, the staff made the night. Warm smiles, great recommendations, and the kind of service that makes you want to come back.",

I'm not the biggest fan of frozen drinks by the app plenty of them including a lychee one which was cute. The margarita and mezcal drinks were very tasty. The starter show Food Wise was there pork belly. It was so delicious crispy flavorful and I would go back just for that. The nachos were just okay. You also got the fried jalapenos. Now the star of the show was the guacamole which you cannot pass on. Perfect combination of flavors and you can tell they put some effort to perfecting their guacamole.",

I will definitely be going back a fourth time.",

Plenty of bar seats after work gyoza, Asahi and ramen affordable as well as numbered rolls.\n\nCrowd keeps on rolling in at 8-9pm. So, reservation recommended. Such a nice vista both from inside and outside.\n\nPricing is reasonable not crazy. $9 beer, quality entree in $20 range as well. Possibly partly why +4.5 rating holds up while some other Japanese restaurant nearby can't.\n\nGam sa ham ni da.",

    "review_text_translated": "I made a reservation and visited on a pleasant Friday evening. I didn't have anything special to do in the area, but I stopped by after a walk to Vessel. The exhibition hall is nearby, but it wasn't too far from Vessel.\n\nI visited with my kids, and while I was disappointed they didn't have tonkatsu, they did have karaage, which made up for it. I ordered a roll and an unagi-don (uncooked unagi), both of which were perfect. I ordered miso ramen and tantanmen (spicy tantanmen), but was disappointed that they served two different tantanmen. Still, I ate it anyway.\n\nHowever, as this restaurant specializes in ramen, the noodles were chewy and the broth was rich, which was really good. The rolls and unagi-don felt more like American fare than Japanese. I was also happy that they also serve Sapporo beer in bottles. The gyoza were better than I expected, and the karaage was above average. This is a restaurant I'd definitely visit again when I have the time.",

Luckily, some tables cleared up and I received a seat for my party of 2 w/in 10 minutes.\n\nI ordered the Kuro shio ramen ($19), made with chicken stock, chicken chashu, egg, mushroom, naruto (fish cake), scallion, edamame, and bamboo shoots. The portion size itself seemed on the delicate, lighter side. The chicken stock with the roasted shiitake mushroom tasted overbearingly mushroomy. The noodles seemed like the usual Sun Noodle brand or similar.\n\nAudaciously, the establishment calls, what in any other setting would be rotisserie chicken breast slices, chicken \"chashu\".",

    "review_text": "A Solid Spot for a Quick Bite\n\nSuram NYC in Hell’s Kitchen is a no-fuss sushi and ramen spot that delivers exactly what you expect. We stopped in for a quick dinner and kicked things off with a couple of sushi rolls—fresh, straightforward, and just right for an appetizer.\n\nFor mains, we each went with ramen built on their creamy twelve-hour chicken stock, topped with chicken chashu, egg, mushroom, naruto, scallion, and edamame. The broth was rich enough to satisfy but not something that lingers in your memory—comforting, though not particularly standout.\n\nThe restaurant itself has a clean, minimalist look, with a vibe that leans toward Japanese-style dining but softened with an American twist. Service was polite, a little brisk, and seemed intent on keeping the evening moving along. Prices felt fair and very much in line with what you’d expect for this type of casual NYC spot.\n\nAll in all, Suram NYC is a decent choice when you’re in the neighborhood and craving sushi and ramen. It won’t blow you away, but it hits the mark for a reliable, uncomplicated meal.\n\n#HellskitchenEats #NYCRamen #SushiAndRamen #QuickBitesNYC",

They comped the filet which was good, but on my birthday dinner sucked. Like sucked. My steak was raw and still had the white fat. Requested it medium. Returned it a 2nd time, and still the same way.

It's important to us that all guests feel welcome.\nHowever, I am offended that you think you were discriminated against, we are very proud of the fact that we have a very diverse staff (as a matter of fact the waitress who served is Eastern European, the Busser is from Bangladesh, the cooks are from Ecuador and the dishwashers are from Mexico). So, it is kind of “Racist” for you to accuse us of Discrimination because of your ethnicity.\nI am sorry you did not like the food you ordered, as a note you had ample time to tell someone on our wait staff we would have taken any measure to get it right either by redoing the dish or replacing it with something else. The one thing we can’t do is read your mind. You told the wait staff you were not pleased after you finished your meal. \nIncidentally $9.00 for a bottle of a 750ml of Premium Water in a Steakhouse is not overpriced. West Side Steakhouse has been referred to as a reasonably priced steakhouse on many, many occasions. I am sorry our prices do not fit your budget but to write a 1-Star review was just totally mean spirited and I think you should really remove it.\nWhen you go to social media you should realize that your words have consequences. This restaurant employes 14 full and part-time employees. Many are the very type of people you pretend to champion, people that work very hard to provide for their families. It’s looks to me like you want us to go out of business and my employees to lose their jobs.\nI don’t know if you feel empowered or if you think you are entitled to say whatever you want, whenever you want to, but civilized people put thought behind their words.\nSo let me give you some words to think about, “Karma knows everyone, and it never forgets where you live”. \n",

For the appetizer, I ordered a crab roll called Hoy Jaw, which was filled with crab meat and had a rich, layered taste—absolutely delicious. Then I had two main dishes: Nuer Tom Bai Horapa and Ka Peak US Wagyu. Both came in generous portions and were bursting with incredible flavor.\n\nFor drinks, I chose a Thai iced tea, and the very first sip completely blew me away. To finish, I ordered a coconut cake for dessert. I couldn’t even wait to take a picture before digging in—it was that tempting! The cake was full of rich coconut aroma and flavor. From the main dishes to the dessert and drinks, everything tasted authentically Thai.\n\nOur server, May, was warm, attentive, and provided excellent service. Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience, and I truly recommend this place to everyone!",

    "review_text": "In my last job, we had an employee who ran our Latin American customer service department and she was straight out of Brazil. Naturally, I had to pick her brain on where the best Brazilian food in Manhattan was, and the only place she would really hang her hat on was Rice X Beans in Hells Kitchen.\n\nA year later, I cashed in this mental note and made the push to the intersection of 10th Ave and 48th street with my big bro.\n\nWe sat down and were greeted by our server who had a strong Brazilian accent, which got me excited. It screamed authenticity. It’s crazy how a simple accent from a server can send me from Manhattan straight to a small restaurant in Rio.\n\nWe scanned the menu and I thought it was interesting how there seemed to be a strong Caribbean influence, as there were empanadas and sweet plantains… but a quick google search tells me that plantains are originally from Southeast Asia and Empanadas originated in Spain. The more I learn about the world, the more I realize I truly know nothing.\n\nWe went with 4 empanadas (2 beef and 2 chicken), BBQ ribs ($16), the Picanha for 2 ($70), and a side of plantains.\n\nThe empanadas were sensational, but in hindsight we should have just got 4 beef as they were much more flavorful than the chicken. Hindsight is always 20/20 though.\n\nThe ribs were the only real miss of the meal, as they were just a bit bland and served luke warm, which concerned me for the main event that was the Picanha.\n\nHowever, when that Picanha came I knew we were in good hands. An enormous portion of the iconic Brazilian style top sirloin that came with fries, farofa, rice, beans, and a side salad. It was so much food that it barely fit on our table for 2. A beautiful site.\n\nThis steak was perfectly medium rare, well seasoned, and had a rich, beefy flavor with a buttery melt-in-your-mouth fat cap. The sides were an ideal pairing with this cut of steak, with the rice and plantains being the standouts. This was almost like a jasmine rice where you could taste each individual grain, and had a subtle garlic and onion flavor.\n\nThese plantains were some of the best I’ve had in the city, as they were carmelized with a soft and tender texture. They taste even better than they looked which is saying A LOT.\n\nI sound like a broken record at this point, but it always amazes me how in New York, you can get a high level of any cuisine from across this beautiful planet. Also, shoutout to my former coworker for the rec. You can learn something from everyone.\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov__",

All I had to do was give our server the slightest glance & they were back with a fresh glass of bubbly within secs. To say our expectations were exceeded is an understatement. Well worth the price since it wasn’t just a dinner…it was truly an experience! Highly recommend for any special occasion. Only negative I could assume is the environment is def curated by the patrons along with staff. This collective was not shy! Dancing on tables, napkins in air, confetti tossing, & plate smashing GALORE!",

In what world does a manager not even try to understand the problem with the service they’re providing?

A person like that should not be managing a place where customer service is key! He should be ashamed of himself! Absolutely disgusting! I will never go back to this place, ever! And I will never recommend a place that doesn’t make its customers feel comfortable! As someone who works with people, I always treat them the way I would want to be treated.

However, we were served two dishes that looked very similar — not what we were expecting or hoping for. When we kindly tried to return the second dish, the manager insisted we keep it and told us, “What would you do if you had a restaurant?”\nThis interaction made us feel very uncomfortable, and honestly, it took away our appetite and desire to stay and enjoy the rest of the meal.\nWe wanted to share this feedback in the hope that future guests might have a better, more respectful experience.",

THE MANAGER CAME TO OUR TABLE MAD!\nSaid it was our problem for not understanding the dish, forced us to eat the dish when we are telling him we don’t want this dish !! He left the table after that attitude. We were so confused. We gave the dish to one of the waiters and told him to tell the manager that we really don’t want this dish please take it. THE MANAGER CAME BACK WITH BIGGER ATTITUDE!! Telling us that it’s our fault !! I saw he was attacking my friend while she was trying to explain that it’s just not what we were expecting. I told him that there is no reason to be hard on it and everything is ok . He just looked at me said OK and left. To be honest our night was ruined because of his attitude towards us. We just paid the bill we don’t mind to pay it really! We are just in shock from this service !!!\n\nאני וחברה שלי יצאנו לאכול במסעדה הזאת ורצינו להנות מהאווירה והאוכל. בגלל שהתפריט לא היה ברור לנו יצא שהזמנו מנה שונה ממה שחשבנו שתהיה. ביקשנו מהמלצרית פשוט לקחת את המנה הזאת בחזרה בגלל אי הבנה. הגיע המנהל של המקום!! שם לנו את המנה בחזרה על השולחן!! הם גישה מתגוננת מראש ותוקפנית ואומר לנו מה הבעיה ?? אנחנו מסבירות לו שזאת לא המנה שציפינו שתהיה והוא מתחיל להגיד שזאת בעיה שלנו ואשמתנו שלא הבנו את המנה והכריח אותנו לאכול אותה !! הוא עזב את השולחן ונשארנו בהלםםםם !! ביקשתי ממלצר אחר לקחת את המנה מהשולחן כי אנחנו מסתכלות על זה ואומרות אנחנו לא רוצות את המנה הזאת בבקשה תקחו אותה מפה. המנהל שוב פעם חזר והפעם עוד יותר עצבני!! ממשיך להאשים אותנו שזה בעיה שלנו שלא הבנו את המנה וכשראיתי אותה צועק על חברה שלי ומנסה להביך אותה על האי הבנה שאלתי אותו למה הוא כלכך קשה עם לקוחות ?? הכל טוב.. הוא פשוט הסתכל לי בעיניים דפק פרצוף אמר ״טוב״. והלך. האמת היא שכבר לא נשאר לנו תאבון לאכול את שאר המנות הוא ממש הרס לנו את המצב רוח.. באמת שאין לנו בעיה לשלם את החשבון אבל וואלה זה לא על הכסף זה פשוט על השירות המזעזע הזה. אני מקווה שאתה קורא את זה ולומד מזה. זאת לא דרך לדבר ככה עם לקוחות וזאת לא הגישה. ויש גישה לכל דבר אנחנו סך הכל התבלבלנו במנות מותר ללקוח להתבלבל הכל טוב ..",

Because the menu was not clear to us it turned out that we ordered a different dish than what we thought it would be. We asked the waitress to simply take this dish back due to a misunderstanding. The manager of the place arrived!! He put the dish back on the table for us!! He has a defensive and aggressive attitude and tells us what the problem is?? We explain to him that this is not the dish we expected and he starts saying that it is our problem and it is our fault that we did not understand the dish and forced us to eat it!! He left the table and we were shocked!! I asked another waiter to take the dish from the table because we were looking at it and saying we don't want this dish, please take it away. The manager came back again and this time was even more angry!! He kept accusing us that it was our problem that we didn't understand the dish and when I saw her yelling at my friend and trying to embarrass her for the misunderstanding I asked him why he was so hard on customers?? Everything is fine.. He just looked me in the eye, made a face and said \"fine\". And left. The truth is that we no longer had any appetite left to eat the rest of the dishes. He really ruined our mood.. We really have no problem paying the bill but wow, it's not about the money, it's just about this shocking service. I hope you read this and learn from it. This is not the way to talk to customers and this is not the attitude. And there is an attitude to everything. We just got confused about the dishes. The customer is allowed to get confused. Everything is fine..",

    "review_text": "Disappointing, Overpriced, and Not Worth the Hype – Avoid HaSalon NYC\n\nWe came to HaSalon as a group of five, expecting a fun night with good food and drinks. What we got instead was a frustrating and disappointing experience that felt more like a scam than a high-end dining experience.\n\nWe weren’t very hungry, so we ordered a few dishes (3–4 total) and a bottle of wine, thinking we’d enjoy a light meal and focus more on drinks. Shortly after, our waitress came over and told us there’s a minimum spend of $100 per person – on food only. We were surprised. We politely explained that we weren’t here to eat heavily, just to enjoy the vibe and have drinks. But she insisted, saying it’s policy and there’s no way around it.\n\nWe asked to speak with the manager, who offered to “help” by creating a menu that would meet the $100 per person food minimum – that’s $500 total, not including alcohol. Not ideal, but we went along with it just to salvage the night.\n\nAt the end of the night, the bill came to over $1,000, including just $200 worth of drinks, meaning we had been forced to spend way more on mediocre food. To top it off, they automatically added a 20% tip per person, which felt outrageous given the experience.\n\nThe food? Mostly average. A couple of dishes were borderline flavorless, and only the steak stood out as truly good. Everything else was forgettable or disappointing. For the price and pressure, this felt less like a fine dining experience and more like a money grab.\n\nBetween the hidden minimums, the aggressive upselling, and the mediocre food, HaSalon was a complete letdown. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone – there are far better places to spend your money and enjoy yourself in NYC.",

    "review_text": "Well, this place is quite unique — not so much for the food, but for the incredible ambiance. People were singing and dancing on tables, the waiters offered us shots and were super friendly, and we ended up chatting with lots of other guests. We had a great time and shared a lot of laughs!\n\nThat said, it’s definitely overpriced. We spent $500 for two people, which feels steep considering the food was just okay — good, but not remarkable. The first bottle of wine starts at $105, though I have to admit the Mercurey we chose was excellent ($135, compared to about €60 online, so fair enough).\n\nIn conclusion, if you’re looking for a wild, festive night out and you’re not too worried about the bill, this spot delivers on atmosphere and fun. Just don’t come expecting culinary excellence.",

No bread dish is worth $20 or fig salad worth $30, even in NYC.",

    "review_text": "It makes sense to come here for the later reservation to enjoy the few hours before closing, because that’s when the music turns up and people start dancing. I can’t say the food was bad — it wasn’t spectacular — some things (like the steak) were delicious, while others were meh. But I can definitely say that it was overpriced. We eat dinner in NYC all the time — if you charge like $50 for small apps, I have certain expectations, and they are not met when it’s 1/2 of a potato with sour cream. The portions were comically small, and we were starving despite ordering more than what the waitress recommended. Ended up getting pizza across the street after. Good pizza, but that’s sad after you’ve spent a few bills per person at a restaurant. The cocktails were good and the wine list had very good options. I got the feeling that the food isn’t really their “thing” — it’s like a cover charge for groups of people to come and get drunk and dance, around others who can afford it. People were getting up on the tables and chairs and dancing, after the evening reached a certain point. It was a pretty fun experience, especially if you don’t expect it. I would recommend this place for a larger group that wants to drink, dance, and snack, but not for dinner or restaurant/food enthusiasts.",

    "review_text": "A truly authentic Italian NYC dining experience as the owner frequented our table to check on us and regale us with stories of his family and the rich tradition of the dishes we so thoroughly enjoyed.\nWe started with a traditional bruschetta - fresh chopped tomatoes in divine EVOO. topped with arugula on crispy bread. The Sicilian insalata was a perfect blend of Fennel, orange, arugula, olives, oregano, red pepper flakes, EVOO. The flavors blending together to make this better than any dinner salad. The penne with pomodoro sauce was a delicious choice for our entree. A flavorful tomato sauce served with al dente pasta and fresh basil.\nFor wine we chose a Pinot Grigio and a Chianti. Both excellent choices to accent our food. We ended with tiramisu -Dark espresso, mascarpone, whipped cream and lady fingers, sambuca and limoncello.\nThe ambience is set for romance with its intimate space and simple Italian inspired decor. A small restaurant with a big heart.",

The ambiance is cozy and chic, perfect for a date night with its quiet and intimate atmosphere.\n\nWe started with the Carpaccio di Angus, which was fresh and delicious, topped with arugula, asparagus, and Parmigiano. For the main course, I had the Filetto di Salmone—perfectly cooked salmon with a rich butter-lemon sauce, cauliflower puree, and grilled asparagus. My boyfriend had the Pappardelle al Ragu di Salsiccia, and he was thoroughly impressed with the pasta.\n\nWe finished with a creamy dessert that was the perfect way to end the meal. The portions were generous, and the prices were more than reasonable for the quality of the food. Service was top-notch—attentive and friendly. Highly recommend, and we’ll definitely be back!",

    "review_text": "I recently celebrated my 40th birthday at Il Melograno, and I must say, it was nothing short of spectacular! From the moment we started planning the event to the evening itself, the proprietors, Lino and Gregory, went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect.\n\nThe ambiance of Il Melograno is both cozy and chic, providing the ideal backdrop for a memorable evening with friends. We opted for a pre-fixe menu, which was expertly curated to cater to a variety of dietary preferences, including vegetarian and pescatarian options. Each dish, from the shared appetizers to the delectable desserts, was beautifully presented and delicious.\n\nWhat truly set this experience apart was the exceptional service. Lino and Gregory’s attention to detail, accommodating nature, and warm hospitality made us feel truly special. They even surprised me with a stunning bouquet – a gesture that touched my heart deeply.\n\nFor anyone looking for a venue that offers not only exquisite Italian cuisine but also personalized and caring service, Il Melograno is the place to go. I am already looking forward to my next visit!\n\nThank you, Lino and Gregory, for making my 40th birthday an evening to remember. I cannot recommend Il Melograno highly enough!",

The food, the service and atmosphere are all top notch. My husband and I highly recommend the salmon, swordfish, stripped bass (a special), the pork chop, the chicken Milanese, the veal ravioli - in short everything we ordered was prepared with great care for flavor and balance.  The salads, soups and appetizers are all varied enough with daily specials to choose from to make repeat visits a must.  The service is friendly and meals delivered hot from the kitchen.  We’ve noticed that several early guests chose this restaurant before going to the theatre which is a few blocks east.\n\nWe only wish we’d found il melagrano sooner.\n\nDoug and Dan   NYC",

The Za’atra scallops was both creamy and light crispy texture with the full taste of the sea and the creamy pesto to balance a sense of woodlands. This is a must try encounter. So amazing. The service was wonderful and kind and polite.My server  Jorge was kind , polite and very attentive. I felt like royalty.",

    "review_text": "Enjoyed our meal at Frena overall however there were a few detractors that caused me to give a lower rating. Given the delicious food I might go back again as it is a different offering close to the theatre district.\n\nThe pros:\nFood was excellent!\nService attentive and honest.\n\nThe cons:\nPayment system error - pay attention\nNot timely if you are heading to a show - aggravated further due to incorrect order.\n\nHostess lovely and acknowledged we were there for my friend’s birthday.\nI reserved the “chef’s area” as it was advertised as the place to see the activity of the kitchen which is typically a special experience. The exact wording from Resy - “The Chef's Area offers views of the kitchen and a more intimate dining experience.” Upon arrival we were directed to a table for two permitting only one person any type of view and the other would have their back to the “kitchen.” Thankfully as we were there early prior to heading to a show. I spied a corner table and we were able to switch. As I looked around, I realized that the “kitchen view” was a view of the wood burning oven and food exiting the kitchen for service and service staff milling about to receive food to place on tables. Definitely not my typical experience of a chef’s area or kitchen view. Suggest they remove that seating option on their site as it is deceiving.\n\nWe told our waiter we needed to leave by 6:30pm as soon as we were seated at 5:10pm. We quickly ordered sambusak - spiced cheese bread, falafel, Moroccan cigars and the special fish entree. Initial dishes came out timely and were delicious. Then our entree arrived at 6:16pm which was fine as we could head out immediately after eating it quicker than we would have liked. However, it was the wrong dish. So it took time to find our server who apologized And went to make a swap - another special fish was in the oven for another table so we would have to wait. Our dish arrived at 6:26pm and we quickly ate it. Definitely no time for any birthday dessert celebration for my friend. In the meantime I also asked for the check and they kindly comped the one glass of wine ordered. I quickly paid and then realized that while I gave a generous tip of 22% because the server so quickly apologized for the entree order mistake and owned it, my card was charged much more than it should be. Had to have a manager come to look and sure enough the system charged a 33% tip! So this had to be corrected and now I have to monitor my card to make sure it is appropriately charged. After looking at the receipt, I realized that the tip was charged on the full order including the mistaken dish.",

We started with their “ Dip Trio”where we selected Humus, Tzatziki and Baba Ganoush with their “ Signature Frena Bread”. We could have happily enjoyed a few breads witb various additional appetizers but we also ordered their Branzino, which was also delicious. For dessert, we shared their phenomenal Halva Silvan Sundae: Vanilla Ice cream, caramelized rice crispies, almonds snd shaved halva! Wow! That was a fabulous climax to an outstanding dinner. The service staff was excellent and we chose to sit outside, which was significantly quieter than inside their lovely dining rooms.",

    "review_text": "Frena is definitely a friend to me!\n\nI mean that literally...\n\n\"Frena is a traditional Moroccan bread, baked in a local communal oven, on top of burning hot pebbles. This bread has a thin crust and a fluffy crumb, absolutely delicious!\"\n\n“Yes carbs are the enemy but we are suppose to love thy neighbors and thy enemies and I love thine bread!”\n\nLike most of my city restaurant experiences, Frena was a random pick. On a Sunday in June, I happened to pull into a parking spot across from Frena and just like that, I decided to give them a try.\n\nUpon entry the decor is beautiful, perfect for a date or a group event. You feel like you are dining in a private garden with the cascading plants off of the ceiling around the bar. Instantly you want to sit and stay for a while.\n\nI started with a \"Birds of a Feather\" a signature cocktail made with Bourbon Rum. A perfect choice, it was well balanced and refreshing without being too sweet.\n\nIn addition an order of Hummus w/ Frena bread and Duo of Falafel was placed. The Hummus was absolutely delish, you can eat it by the spoonful, but the Frena bread was simply amazing. Order extra you will need it and it will be worth both the extra carbs and the extra charge. The Falafels are green herb and sweet potato falafel with tahini and mango chutney. Both were good, but admittedly, I enjoyed the sweet potato falafel with the mango chutney more than the traditional. They had a subtle sweet taste with a nice unexpected departure from the earthy flavor of the green herbs.\n\nOf course the indulgence of the Hummus and Frena bread made it difficult to continue as capacity had been reached. However, an order of Schnitzel Shishi had arrived. Schnitzel Shishi a breaded crispy chicken flatbread with a shifka aioli and pickled red cabbage slaw. The schnitzel was both packed and traveled well. The server offered to pack the dish when it arrived noticing that we could not possibly consume another morsel.\n\nService was attentive and swift with serval staff members tending to the table. Some members were a little more engaging than others but overall no complaints.\n\nJust A Note:\n\n- The Hummus and Frena bread is a MUST. Thank me later!\n\n- A Brunch Menu is available.",

We recently stopped by for dinner and were told there were no available tables, even though half the restaurant was visibly empty. When we checked Resy, there were plenty of open reservations. It seems they strongly prefer reservations over walk-ins, which is understandable, but the handling could be more gracious. I’d also suggest they consider being more accommodating to families perhaps offer at least one kid-friendly option or be willing to check with the kitchen for simple modifications. A little flexibility and better service could go a long way.",

We are always happy to seat walk-ins when possible! \nWhile we don't have a formal kid's menu, you were offered gnocchi with butter, falafels, bread, dips without spices, and the zucchini cakes as child-friendly options. We are always delighted to host families! ",

This Lower East Side gem brings the vibrant spirit of Istanbul to New York City, and it does it with serious style.\n\n**📍 The Vibe:**\nWalking into Frena feels like stepping into a chic Mediterranean hideaway—exposed brick, intimate lighting, and just the right amount of buzz. Whether you're here for a date night or a group feast, the energy is electric yet inviting.\n\nAnd don’t sleep on their **cocktails**—creative, balanced, and packed with flavors like saffron and pomegranate.\n\n**💯 Why Frena Stands Out:**\nThis isn’t just dinner; it’s an **experience**. The team makes you feel like family, the playlist is always on point, and every dish tells a story. It’s the kind of place you’ll want to revisit just to try everything—and then order your favorites all over again.\n\n**⭐ Final Verdict:**\nFrena nails it—**flavor, atmosphere, and soul**. If you’re in NYC and *not* eating here, you’re missing out. **10/10, will be back ASAP.**",

Also, the zucchini cakes were delish but had lime (or some sort of citrus fruit)that was SO startlingly sour, we should’ve been given a warning. My friend is pregnant and I felt terrible. also, we were given the check before being asked if we wanted dessert which was extremely rude, especially because we were there for her birthday.
