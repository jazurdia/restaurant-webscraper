The food here is next-level — beautifully presented and absolutely bursting with flavor.

I ordered the ceviche, and it was to die for. Fresh, vibrant, and perfectly balanced — easily one of the best I’ve ever had. The “trust latches” (the crispy fried bites served alongside) were equally amazing, a must-try combination. Every dish was plated with such care and creativity, making it not just a meal but an experience.

The atmosphere is warm, modern, and stylish — perfect for enjoying authentic Peruvian cuisine with a contemporary touch. On top of that, the service was outstanding. Our waiter, Louis, went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience. He was so attentive, helpful, and genuinely welcoming, which made the meal even more enjoyable.

If you’re in the area, I highly recommend stopping by Mission Ceviche. Whether you’re a fan of Peruvian food or trying it for the first time, this place will absolutely impress you. I’ll definitely be coming back!",,1043,2025-10-01T16:21:08.805Z,5 days ago,0,184,True,"Hey Robert,

The dishes tend to be sweet, but my mom felt it tasted too salty, so there’s definitely a cultural component to how you might perceive the food. When we arrived, it was starting to get busy (around ~5-5:30), so the workers started to set up a second location for dine in. My group of three ended up on one of the outside tables by this second location. I really appreciate Up Thai’s interior design so I was a little disappointed with not being able to show my family inside. Otherwise, dining outside went really smoothly. Servers paid thorough attention to customers outside, so I did not feel like we were lacking anything in comparison to sitting inside.

The flavors weren’t mind-blowing or life-changing, but everything was executed very well.

We got the mango avocado salad, the clay-pot fried rice, and the soft shell crab in red curry from the summer menu.

Our favorite was probably the mango avocado salad—it had a perfect level of spice and acidity to complement the rest of the meal. The clay pot fried rice was a bit underwhelming for me. Although the blend of different types of meat offered great textures, the flavor was uniform throughout the entire dish—everything tasted like sweet soy sauce or eel sauce.

The ambiance was excellent — elegant, modern, and very clean. The decoration felt refined and fancy, creating a welcoming yet upscale atmosphere.The food was truly the highlight of the evening. The tuna tartar was absolutely delicious, fresh and perfectly balanced. The octopus was tender and flavorful, while the salmon was simply outstanding. Every dish showed great attention to quality and preparation.The only disappointment was the limonada. It lacked the freshness and flavor expected and didn’t quite match the otherwise high standard of the menu.The service was attentive and friendly, making the experience even more enjoyable.While the restaurant was spotless and beautifully decorated, the bathroom did not live up to the same standard as the dining area. This is an area that could definitely be improved to better align with the restaurant’s overall image.
Despite a couple of small drawbacks, I left very happy with the food, the service, and the environment. I would definitely return for another meal and recommend it, especially for the outstanding dishes.",,1164,2025-09-02T23:48:22.640Z,a month ago,0,142,True,"Thank you so much for sharing your detailed and thoughtful review!

Quite an impressive memory I’d say.

I always sit at the bar when I come in , the seats are comfortable and the drinks are solid. They serve a Sancerre by the glass which I greatly appreciate and enjoy. The bartender Elif is excellent. She knew the food menu and made great suggestions.  I’m in the restaurant business and she cranked out service drinks to the busy tables all night and didn’t seem to break a sweat.

We came in for a quick dinner (couple with a young child). Our daughter was starting to act up after a long day of being out and about so we cut our order short realizing it was going to be a challenge having ordered some food for her and my wife in-advance already.

We ordered a main and a side and a glass of bubbly and the waiter visually and verbally got upset at us and shook his head and said ""really just two items"" and stormed away. Didn't realize there was was a minimum spend requirement and another couple beside us just ordered a burger to share and nothing else yet didn't receive this sort of treatment..

Absolutely unprofessional behavior from the bartender and maybe needs to be reminded that he's in the hospitality business. The place wasn't even that busy to begin with so it's not like we were hogging up valuable real estate.

Food was average - it's a neighborhood type feel with its own charm but definitely won't be coming back based on the bartenders disgraceful attitude.",,1044,2025-08-16T23:21:30.313Z,a month ago,0,483,True,,,

Not coming back.

We waited 45 minutes to over an hour for our food with zero updates. Halfway through, we were told they had run out of fries, which were supposed to be included with the meals. Instead of offering any kind of reasonable solution, we were given just two options: cancel or order the food without fries at the same price — no compensation, no apology.

We chose to replace the fries with vegetables (the only alternative available), only to find out they charged the vegetables as a paid extra — even though fries were included in the original dish. So we ended up paying more for less, simply because they didn’t have something essential on the menu.

We also ordered 2 medium burgers and 1 well done, but all came out medium rare. When we tried to address the issue, the responses were dismissive: “this is how it’s done here” or “for the future, this is a place where it takes forever.”

It’s fine if there are delays or issues, it happens. But tell your customers upfront, not when they’re already seated and committed. Also, making people feel like they can’t ask questions or express concerns is not okay.

If your restaurant often runs into these problems, at least show some accountability or basic customer care. Unfortunately, this experience was frustrating, overpriced, and poorly handled from start to finish.
We ended up paying 50$ per person for a beer in a can and a burger wrongly cooked, without fries and with the side dish we didn’t want.",,1539,2025-04-26T03:04:27.441Z,5 months ago,0,12,True,,,

The meatballs were just okay—small in size (six per order, good for sharing) with a sauce that tasted more onion-forward than I remember. Not bad, but not a standout.

The tables are too small and too close together. The chairs are uncomfortable. The room is so loud & crowded you can’t have a conversation. They refuse to bring you bread until after you order your entrée. The appetizers came in four minutes, proving that nothing was made to order. It tasted microwave hot. The oil used for frying was old and bitter. The waitstaff was kind of rude and impatient. The pasta sauce tasted like it was made with  cheap tomato paste. It had that cheap, bitter aftertaste. The duck was so tough that it wasn’t chewable. The menu does a terrible job describing the food that they bring you. Literally nothing about the experience was good or noteworthy.

We have both lived on the UES and had never been. So, we were thrilled when we got a reservation for 7:45 on a Saturday! We were greeted by a very friendly host and were seated immediately. Then we met our waitress…who couldn’t have been less friendly…
Her tone and demeanor towards us was unfriendly from the moment she came to take our drink order. Our food took over 40 minutes to come out and after we ordered our appetizers, she did not come to check on us once…while we saw her tending to other tables and saw other tables that arrived after us get their orders before we did, as well as multiple rounds of drinks. By the time our food finally came out, I was starved. It was clear they forgot about us and scrambled to get our food out quickly. The shrimp in my pasta were grey..clearly not fully cooked. My pasta was drastically under-seasoned. Our waitress, again, avoided us. Didn’t come over to ask if we were happy with our food. By the time we had finished eating what we could, we asked for the check before they had even cleared our plates. I don’t know what was going on and I can’t remember the last time I had a BAD meal in NYC…until today. I was beyond disappointed by UVA. A place I have been dying to try for years. It’s safe to say I’ll never be coming back and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.",,1405,2025-08-03T01:48:05.480Z,2 months ago,0,6,False,,,

Delicious, full of flavor and obviously using the correct ingredients as we did not feel drowsy afterwards (seems to be an issue with Italian places in our experience - maybe an issue California?).

What a disappointment!  The food is horrible.   The pasta is mushy and without flavor. The appetizers were inedible. The prices are inflated and the atmosphere combines stuffiness with arrogance.  On top of this, the servers were all rude and uncaring.  They all exude a feeling of superiority, while making sure that one feels unwelcome. No one even bothered to check on us, or ask why the meal sat uneaten on our table.
We finally left our uneaten food, paid the bill without discount and found another restaurant that understood customer service.
I am not one to complain about restaurants, but my advice on this one would be to avoid at all costs.",,721,2024-12-30T17:37:01.146Z,9 months ago,0,1,False,,,

I walked in on a cold evening because the place was empty and looked nice. The service? LOWSY! I ordered a drink that tasted like they don’t clean their soda fountain, I also asked a question about a certain dish, the server went to go “ask” and literally never came back to the table. I sat there maybe a total of 36 minutes just waiting with my gross drink, until I decided to leave, in a packed restaurant I would have more grace, in a dining room with only two other tables full? NOT. I went to the bar to pay for my gross drink only then did the waiter hurry over -because they probably thought I would leave without paying. (I’m not a heathen)  I paid and then they turned the device over and had the AUDACITY to ask if I wanted to tip!

We were looking for a British breakfast spot for our early Saturday morning before heading to the Met Museum, and John’s Wood was definitely on our radar.

We had done our homework beforehand, so we ordered right away.

First up was the Scotch Egg which was egg wrapped in sausage. It was a bit different from what I had in mind, especially the portion size. Overall, it was just okay.

We also tried the Fish Burger and Shepherd’s Pie. The Shepherd’s Pie was simple, authentic, and really enjoyable. The Fish Burger, however, was a bit bland for my taste.

Overall, it was a decent spot. I’d consider coming back to try their Fish & Chips, maybe next time!",,704,2025-07-06T22:11:18.842Z,3 months ago,0,146,True,"Hi Piboon,

It’s been a while since I’ve been back but decided to take a friend for dinner on a Friday night. The service was great but unfortunately the food has gone really down hill. Especially for the price.

The bread was cold and flavorless. On the chewy side.
The salad portion for two has decreased considerably for two. The mouruli salad is shredded lettuce and feta. Just a very small portion.

I ordered a glass of Sauvignon blanc and I’m pretty sure I was drinking Chardonnay.

The sea bass was a full fish for $42 which I would gladly pay because sea bass is delicious! However, we split it and the entire fish was maaaybe 4oz of meat so we each consumed less than 2oz of protein and it was not fluffy nor flavorful.

A manager came by and asked how everything was. So I told her I was disappointed with the fish and explained why. She did nothing which was surprising. I gave them a chance to offer something but it seems this is what they offer customers.

Just a very unenjoyable meal all around.

I feel terrible that I have to write this review but my hope is that they make the necessary changes so they can go back to being one of the best Greek restaurants in NYC. The atmosphere is the same, quite nice. Our server was excellent. The food however was unacceptable. As a Greek, I'm very familiar with our tastes. For starters, the tzatziki sauce was a bland spoonful of yogurt. Though I understand that some people don't like too much garlic, this had close to none. It also lacked the zing of acid which typically comes from a splash of vinegar. Completely tasteless and runny. The zucchini fritters (kolokithokeftedes) were almost completely black on the exterior which tells me that the oil they used to fry them should have been changed a long time before they fried these. The fried calamari was extremely rubbery. The one appetizer that was decent was the octopus. Last but not least, the bread that they started us off with was very stale. This is not the Yefsis I knew and once visited weekly :( Having said all this, because it was several years since I had been here, I looked at the reviews to make sure it was still what it used to be. This is why I was so surprised that the food came the way it came. The photos and the reviews written by others were very positive. Perhaps the chef who is spoken so highly of (I'm sure she must be wonderful) was absent on that Sunday evening?",,1452,2024-06-24T13:40:36.244Z,a year ago,0,256,True,,,

I was pleasantly surprised by the modern atmosphere without a bunch of Georgian ethnic decorations all over the place. The young and great looking staff in plain black looked very sheek, and the older bartender in white created a nice black and white contrast. No logos, no clutter, very clean. We both ordered khinkali, quick and straightforward.

The wait for the dumplings turned into a very long delay. When I asked about the status of order, the waiter told me they take a long time to steam and that the water needs to boil. To me, that is ridiculous. Any professional kitchen should have boiling water ready. Even at home I keep a thermos with boiling water for tea or soup. For a staple dish served all day, this made no sense.

The wait was so long that we ended up having multiple conversations and a bathroom visit for both of us!

I asked the hostess if they had any bread, since many restaurants do that. I felt that the Georgians who pride themselves on being the best host,  would embrace this opportunity. She flatly said no. It is not her job, but still, nobody checked in on us for a long time. Nobody even refilled our water. Later I called over another waiter, very nice young guy,  and he helped us pass time discussing tradition of bread, with explanations about how it is baked and pictures.

The bathroom was actually quite nice, especially for Manhattan, but with a random photograph of two parrots on the wall.
The wait dragged on. My dumplings came out at least ten minutes before my son’s. We usually eat together, so I waited. By the time his food came, my dumplings were predictably cold, and nothing was done about it even after i commented.

Weird: My plate had sour cream, and his plate had a little glass pepper shaker placed right on the plate. That was the most random thing because those shakers are usually sitting on the table next to the salt, not sitting next to your food, touching it.

The vegetarian mushroom dumplings were wonderful, but cold. I also want to note that the prices on the online menu $10 did not match what was presented at the restaurant 12.95.

Afterward they cleared our table completely, even whipped it, but did not bring the bill. Any restaurant knows the check should follow when the last plate leaves. Instead, we sat at an empty wiped table waiting even more, missing a beautiful sunset. I finally asked the redhead waitress for the check and told her it was annoying that my food came ten minutes before my son’s. For a small party of two, entrees should arrive together and hot.

That is when the real fun began. In my attempt to leave after 1+hr, the opposite happened. I was surrounded by the bartender on one side and the redhead on the other, standing within two feet of me. They insisted the meal would be on them and refused to let me leave unsatisfied. The bartender kept saying ""i take the blame"" even though he never serviced our table,  and switched to speaking Russian, which I did not appreciate in the context of today’s politics. I felt insulted by the switch in language during all of this, as if I had any difficulty explaining myself in English (I do not,  I assure you).

I found it ironic, since earlier we had discussed how free food can be considered insulting in Georgian tradition. Our entire intention was just a quick fifteen minute in and out for a couple of appetizers turned into more than an hour boredom and cold food. My bill was small. I insisted on paying, and it turned into another long back and forth. I even told them I would leave a bad review (hey,  I never said I wouldn't even if they did)  if they did not let me pay.

And in the middle of all that back and forth, I missed the sunset. Totally wasted evening.  we already ate at the jazz club,  but even after all this waiting,  I was ironically starting to feel very hungry again.
I came full,  and left hungry.",,4067,2025-08-19T01:21:28.941Z,a month ago,0,166,True,"Dear Anna,

We weren’t planning on a big dinner, just a quick taste of the place.
We ordered khinkali dumplings, expecting them to arrive fairly quickly. Instead, we waited. And waited. When my mom and I both asked what was taking so long, but I am used to everything taking longer in Georgian culture.

The wait stretched on long enough that we started running out of patience. My mom asked the hostess if anything like bread was available while we waited.  the restaurant was far from packed. Eventually we waived for another server to stop at our table,  finally

When the dumplings finally started to come, they didn’t arrive together. My mom’s plate showed up first, and mine didn’t come until about 10-15 minutes later. She tried to wait for me, but by the time my food came out, hers had cooled off. This food can't be consumed cold,  the cold dough turns into chewey rubber.

What I received was three dumplings and, oddly, a small glass pepper shaker resting right on the plate next to the food. Not on the table, but literally on the dish itself. It looked random. My mom’s dumplings came with sour cream, which at least made sense.

The lamb dumplings tasted good.

When we finished, the servers cleared the table completely but then left us sitting with nothing. No check appeared. We ended up just staring at an empty table, waiting, while the sun was setting outside. Watching that moment slip away was frustrating. Eventually my mom had to go over and ask for the bill herself, and she mentioned to the server how frustrating it was that the plates hadn’t been timed together and having yo wait for the check

At that point we just wanted to pay and leave, but instead things took an even stranger turn. All of a sudden, the bartender randomly appeared and one of the servers positioned themselves on either side of my mom, like blocking her.  This turned into an uncomfortable back and forth.

The whole thing dragged on far longer than it should have. the staff went in circles. Then, to make things worse, they switched to speaking Russian while addressing my mom.
Very long and strange experience.

This friday it seemed appropriate to have a closer look. Made the reservation, signed and sealed. I walk in a gesture to the host, reservation. He escorts me to my table. I sit down as though I am some sort of highly respected food critic (one day). He comes over shortly after with a menu, another man drops off a bottle of water.

Eventually I order, I might add at this point that the service throughout my meal had seemed merely transactional, no words were exchanged above what was absolutely necessary. Something that doesn’t necessarily bother me, but something to note. Perhaps it is a Georgian attitude, I know my Armenian grandmother can come off like this at time - that point is related to the extent Georgians and Armenians are similar, which I am not sure. I digress. I order Soko Ketze and the Chakapuli, to be accompanied by a glass of red georgian Kvevri wine. The Soko Ketze was underwhelming, and i partly blame myself in choosing poorly among the options, but it was essentially white button mushrooms that were only slightly cooked and didn’t appear to have much seasoning, then melted georgian cheese on top, the cheese was good but seemed haphazardly put together, both of which sat in a pool of butter. The Chakapuli was great, tender lamb bits nestled amongst some great punchy herbs of tarragon, parsley, mint, and i’m sure others. bread was good too and the wine i very much enjoyed.

Other notes: really cool interior and chinaware.

Would come back to try other dishes.",,1592,2025-08-10T03:12:54.569Z,a month ago,0,21,True,"Ethan, thank you for sharing such a detailed review.

We’ve been to nine other Georgian restaurants and bakeries around the U.S. — and Oda House is the best we’ve had so far!

The quality of the Khinkali (lamb soup dumplings) was much better than others we’ve had. The Khachpuri was incredible (iykyk that Imeruli is even better tasting than the IG trend egg boat Adjaruli) — a pro tip is to help balance the heaviness with their pickles side and ask for ajika (a peppery sauce that is great - it’s not on the menu but should be!). The only thing that could have made the meal even more perfect would be to have Churchkhela available to-go!

Thanks to the team for a special meal and while there are quite a few other Georgian places in NYC, definitely go here and you won’t regret it!",,813,2025-07-19T03:38:32.323Z,2 months ago,0,11,True,"Zach, thank you for your wonderful review!

stopped there the other day for well deserved hydration break on our 27 miles walk. Busy yet fast service, helpful staff. Good amount of options.

I went on Friday and it was hands-down one of the best burger experiences I’ve had in years. The meat was perfection—juicy, tender, and literally melted in my mouth. It was cooked to absolute perfection.

On top of the incredible food, the service made the whole experience even better. Nick, the staff member who helped me, was so pleasant, funny, and easy-going. He really added a personal touch that made the visit memorable.

I can’t recommend this place enough. Sin City Burger is easily one of the best burger joints in NYC right now, and I’ll be telling everyone I know to stop by. A true gem!",,699,2025-09-14T19:02:35.567Z,3 weeks ago,0,13,False,,,

The only thing that makes me give it 4 stars is the fries, which are homemade and the portion is very generous for easily 2 people. Katz should take note of this because that's what they're lacking...
Sinom finds the welcome average. Only one employee is there to welcome people. Sinom doesn't exist for others.

The food is amazing and they are very prompt serving the dishes. The attentive staff refills our water without asking, ensuring we stay hydrated throughout our meal. We particularly enjoyed the Tod Mun Goong, a dish of juicy and crispy shrimp cakes with ground pork. It was so delicious that we’ll definitely return just for that.

Another highlight was the Paloh Hang, a dish of tender meat served with a sweet sauce. It reminded us of Hamonado, a Filipino dish. We also tried the Zabb Hang, a dry rice noodle dish that we found more enjoyable than the Pad Thai.

While the restaurant is very busy, especially during dinner, we recommend making reservations if you’re planning to dine with more than four people. Additionally, they only allow 90 minutes of dining, so be sure to plan accordingly.

Overall, our experience at Paloh Hang was excellent and highly recommended.",,933,2025-09-29T10:46:49.948Z,a week ago,0,50,True,,,

We got rose tea and one of the cocktails for drinks. Both were yummy. The star of the show was the mango sticky rice. This was certainly one of the best we've had in a long time!

We also had the morsillas that looked appealing but were bland , lacked flavor and were not savory at all, also a disappointment.  For the entree we were excited to order the signature paella, that people so rave about.  The paella was an interesting one , it was not super bad but also the flavors did not wow me , it did have great amount of fresh seafood but rice was lil too heavy .  Overall this place did not impress me at all . Definitely overrated, meals were mediocre with flavors that were completely off. Seasoning was not good!  👎🏽👎🏽

We also had the morsillas that looked appealing but were bland , lacked flavor and were not savory at all, also a disappointment.  For the entree we were excited to order the signature paella, that people so rave about.  The paella was an interesting one , it was not super bad but also the flavors did not wow me , it did have great amount of fresh seafood but rice was lil too heavy .  Overall this place did not impress me at all . Definitely overrated, meals were mediocre with flavors that were completely off. Seasoning was not good!  👎🏽👎🏽

AWESOME service. Very nice people and great food. Alex(owner) recommended Montaditos Venezuela to complement the Seafood Spicy Paella.
Both were really good. Highly recommend paying this place a visit. This 2 dishes filled me up.
I will definitely be coming here whenever I'm in NYC.  If you go there because you read my review please let them know why you came.

We also had the morsillas that looked appealing but were bland , lacked flavor and were not savory at all, also a disappointment.  For the entree we were excited to order the signature paella, that people so rave about.  The paella was an interesting one , it was not super bad but also the flavors did not wow me , it did have great amount of fresh seafood but rice was lil too heavy .  Overall this place did not impress me at all . Definitely overrated, meals were mediocre with flavors that were completely off. Seasoning was not good!  👎🏽👎🏽

¡Saludos, gente de buen diente y paladar exigente! Recientemente me di la vuelta por Buena Vista y, como buenos puertorriqueños que somos, siempre andamos buscando esa chispa que nos haga decir ""¡epa, esto está brutal!"". Aquí les va mi veredicto, pensando en esos gustos que no se conforman con menos.

Empezamos fuerte con el **Pulpo a la Parrilla**, y déjenme decirles que este plato es un acierto. El pulpo estaba en su punto, tierno por dentro y con ese toque ahumado de la parrilla que tanto nos gusta. Una ejecución que respeta el producto y lo eleva.

Luego le dimos la oportunidad al **Pork Chop** y al **Rib Eye**. Ambos cortes de carne estaban a la altura. El Pork Chop jugoso y con buen sabor, y el Rib Eye con esa grasa infiltrada que le da el gusto que esperamos. Si eres de los que disfrutan una buena carne, aquí no te vas a sentir defraudado.

Pero la verdadera estrella de los especiales fue el **Sea Bass Ceviche**. ¡Qué cosa más sabrosa! Fresco, con el balance perfecto de acidez y ese toque cítrico que te despierta el paladar. Definitivamente, este ceviche tiene el ""flow"" y el gusto que buscamos en un buen plato de mariscos.

Ahora, no todo fue color de rosa. Y es que, con la misma honestidad que alabamos lo bueno, tenemos que señalar lo que no cuadra. Las **Empanadas de Pollo** fueron el único plato que, honestamente, no nos gustó ni un poquito. Aquí hay que hacer un *mea culpa* y o las sacan del menú, o le dan un giro de 180 grados a la receta. No tienen ni la sazón ni la textura que esperaríamos; se sienten fuera de lugar en una cocina que, por lo demás, tiene platos tan bien logrados.

En resumen, [Nombre del Restaurante] tiene mucho potencial y platos que realmente valen la pena probar, especialmente si te inclinas por los mariscos y las carnes. Pero, por favor, ¡a revisar esas empanadas! Para los que tenemos un paladar educado y sabemos cuándo algo está bien hecho, hay opciones excelentes que demuestran que en esta cocina hay talento.","**Review: Buena Vista - Flavors That Stand Out and a Surprise Here and There (for the Puerto Rican Palate)**

Greetings, people with good taste and discerning palates! I recently stopped by Buena Vista and, like the good Puerto Ricans that we are, we're always looking for that spark that makes us say ""Wow, this is awesome!"" Here's my verdict, thinking about those tastes that don't settle for less.

We started strong with the **Grilled Octopus**, and let me tell you, this dish is a success. The octopus was cooked to perfection, tender on the inside, and with that smoky touch from the grill that we love so much. An execution that respects the product and elevates it.

Then we gave the **Pork Chop** and the **Rib Eye** a try. Both cuts of meat were up to par. The Pork Chop was juicy and flavorful, and the Rib Eye had that infiltrated fat that gives it the taste we expect. If you're someone who enjoys good meat, you won't be disappointed here.

But the real star of the specials was the **Sea Bass Ceviche**. What a flavor! Fresh, with the perfect balance of acidity and that citrus touch that awakens your palate. This ceviche definitely has the flow and flavor we look for in a good seafood dish.

Now, not everything was rosy. And, with the same honesty that we praise the good, we have to point out what doesn't fit. The **Chicken Empanadas** were the only dish that, honestly, we didn't like one bit. We have to make a *mea culpa* here, and either they take them off the menu or they give the recipe a complete 180-degree turn. They lack the seasoning or the texture we would expect; they feel out of place in a kitchen that otherwise boasts such well-made dishes.

In short, [Restaurant Name] has a lot of potential and dishes that are truly worth trying, especially if you're leaning toward seafood and meat. But please, check out those empanadas!

I also (unfortunately) found my strawberry and cream calzone a little too salty. I find that unjustifiable. As for the staff, I found them helpful but lacking in friendliness.

Back again one year later I've been thinking about the Cavatelli alla Norma- it was more delicious than I remember. Orecchiette with sausage was also divine.

When I arrived, I was redirected to a hostess stand located quite far from the restaurant itself, where I ended up waiting around ten minutes before being seated — even though the restaurant was basically empty. My server apologized, but it definitely set the tone for the evening.

I ordered a glass of wine and had to ask twice before it finally arrived. Then, when I chose not to order an appetizer, the server seemed frustrated and commented that “the food usually takes longer to cook, so most people get appetizers while they wait.” Ironically, my meal came out very quickly — so that interaction just felt unnecessary and a bit pushy.

The food itself was good, but the overall experience didn’t match the reputation. I left feeling more frustrated than satisfied, which was disappointing since I’d been having such a great night up until then.",,989,2025-10-07T01:16:11.839Z,3 hours ago,0,5,False,,,

Great if you are staying at Arlo Midtown. Prices run a little high and portions lean smaller.

Arlo Midtown has a clean, modern vibe and the restaurant matches it. We stopped in for small plates and cocktails. The Red Hot Cloud was a standout drink. They pour over cotton candy melts into the drink and tastes as fun as it looks. Other cocktails were well made.

Food was good across the board. The steak came with a bright, herby sauce and was cooked right. The smoked potatoes had a nice heat. The warm dinner roll with whipped butter was an awesome starter. Portions are on the smaller side, so it adds up fast.

Service was friendly and efficient. We were seated quickly and staff knew the menu. If you are staying at Arlo, it is a convenient, enjoyable choice. I would not cross town just for it, but I would happily eat here again while on property.

Pro tips
• Order the Red Hot Cloud cocktail.
• Share two or three plates per person.
• If you want a cheaper meal, there are bodegas and quick bites within a short walk.",,1100,2025-09-26T21:48:48.535Z,a week ago,0,28,True,"Hello GregxPerez,

We arrived on time for our reservation and were greeted not with a hello or welcome, but with, “You only have your table for ninety minutes.” That set the tone for the evening.
The atmosphere is chaotic, and the noise level is overwhelming. Tables are packed so closely together—maybe six inches apart—that it feels like you're dining with strangers at your elbows.
Service is rushed, and the pace of the meal feels more like a timed drill than a relaxed night out. The whole experience seems designed to turn over as many tables as possible, as quickly as possible.
In a city like Manhattan, with so many great dining options, there’s no reason to subject yourself to this kind of experience.

We arrived for our 7:30PM reservation and were told to wait outside for a few minutes while they prepped our table, only to wait outside for close to 30 minutes before we finally went back inside to remind them we were still waiting, sitting down around 8PM. Then, they refused to accommodate a member of our party who had an allium allergy - claiming that the chef only wishes to serve dishes authentically and not modify them - so our request to sub-in a simple soy sauce for the existing sauce in a noodle dish was denied. They went so far as to let us know that the manager said it was okay for us to bring in food from outside, at another restaurant, and eat it at the table, instead of trying to make a slightly modified dish to accommodate the allergy. Then to top it all off, they gave us a ""free"" appetizer during the meal to apologize for our wait. That would be great had we not gotten the bill and the ""free"" appetizer we didn't order was listed as a line item, $17, but they deducted a cheaper appetizer (costing $15) off our check instead. So in effect, we paid $2 for an appetizer we never asked for. Truly such a poor experience, and we had high hopes for the restaurant.

We waited over 20 minutes for our drinks, and this was before it even got busy. Once larger tables arrived, we were completely forgotten. Our waiter disappeared, and the busboy was the only one who actually tried to help.

From the moment we sat down, we were interrupted every 20–30 minutes by someone—either the manager or a waitress—telling us how much time we had left. It felt like we were being pushed out the door before we even had the chance to enjoy our meal.

Instead of relaxing and enjoying our food, we spent the evening feeling rushed and uncomfortable. Even when we were still eating, they came again to remind us that our time was almost up. It was very disrespectful and took away from what should have been a pleasant dining experience.

If a restaurant sets a time limit, that’s understandable—but constantly interrupting guests and making them feel unwelcome is not acceptable. Good service is about hospitality and respect, and unfortunately, that was completely missing here.",,943,2025-10-04T01:51:10.486Z,Edited 3 days ago,0,30,True,"Hi Nino,

I booked a party of 15 for a birthday celebration and the team was accommodating and responsive. For groups of 8 or more they offer a pre-fixe menu. The portions were generous, and we even took some food home. The salmon and steak were both excellent. Our servers did a wonderful job handling our (slightly needy!) group with patience and made sure the night was memorable.

I’m giving 4 stars because I was expecting the same high-energy vibe as their Flatiron branch, and our table was all the way in the back. If you book a large group, I recommend requesting a table in the middle or closer to the DJ booth for a livelier experience.

A week later I was with said friends and they told me they got a whole round and weren’t charged for it and I was like maybe you guys got shots for free until I looked at my card charge and noticed Kyma charged me $200 for a full round of shots.

I called to speak with the manager who told me that they don’t do one singular shot and that I should know that. I explained that the hostesses NEVER flagged to me that one shot couldn’t be sent. I am on a NYC budget, had I have been told it needed to be a full round I would have NEVER said yes.

The manager blamed me rather then his hostess who didn’t provide all info or a total amount and told me i’m too young to understand how these things work. He was extremely disrespectful, hanging up on me multiple times throughout the call and not listening to me explain what had occurred. I’m so in shock by how unprofessional he was.

Thankfully I can dispute this unauthorized charge. Next time he should tell his hostesses the rules to share with all customers rather then belittling me and telling me I should know better on how this works.

Was told we had to have our full party to sit, which is 100% understandable. What wasn’t was how they refused to put our name down, after waiting 20 minutes we were then told we had to put our name down to wait another 30 minutes.

There were 3 tables available while we were waiting which made the whole situation even better. Staff was very rude about it and actively hostile.

I had eaten here before and would not recommend further to the mediocre food and terrible staff.

The whole situation would’ve been alleviated if they just put our name on the list while we were already waiting.

Nizuc in Hudson Yards sets the stage with a modern-Mexican aesthetic—sleek lines, an ample bar buzzing with happy-hour energy, and a menu that promises elevated takes on familiar fare. Unfortunately, what lands at the table doesn’t always match the promise.

We began with guacamole and roasted salsa macha alongside tortilla chips. The chips were plentiful, but the guac felt skimpy for the price. The ceviche, served in a coconut milk base, leaned watery and lacked the bright acidity and balance that typically make the dish shine. It felt heavy rather than refreshing, which was disappointing for a starter meant to whet the appetite.

Mains were a mixed bag. The steak arrived aggressively over-seasoned, while both chicken and shrimp fajitas lacked seasoning altogether, leaving them flat. The accompanying tortillas were far too oily, and the chicken mole was simply serviceable without any standout complexity. At $270 for four, the bill aligned with Hudson Yards expectations but didn’t feel justified for the quality.

Service, while polite, was inconsistent—water refills required reminders, the server had to repeatedly check back with the kitchen about dishes, and plates were cleared too eagerly, creating an undercurrent of being rushed toward the check.

Nizuc nails the ambiance and delivers on style, but for now, it feels more like a spot for cocktails and scene than for a meal worth savoring.

When I first arrived, I was told I could not sit outside because it was “only for dinner,” without even asking if I would be dining or not. Two different staff members received me without any manners, which already gave me a bad impression.

After finally being seated, a third staff member came over and rudely told me I was sitting in the wrong place. I explained that I was placed there by their own team, but instead of handling the situation politely, she spoke to me from a distance and made me move myself to another table. I had to carry the menu on my own and relocate without any assistance.

Only later did another staff member arrive who was finally helpful and attentive unfortunately, this was after the whole negative experience.

The food itself was excellent, but the service was absolutely below the standard I would expect from a restaurant of this level.

I’ve tried a few other Mexican restaurants in Manhattan recently, but this one is still my favorite!

I ordered the shrimp taco and fish taco again—just like last time. If you can’t eat too much, I’d especially recommend the shrimp taco—it’s absolutely delicious!😋

Today was even more fun because it happened to be Tuesday. When I got to the door, I realized they have Taco Tuesday deals:
•	A ribeye taco (with a slice of thin steak) for just $5
•	A shrimp taco for $4.50—cheaper than some food trucks!
And the best part? They’re super tasty!

(Regular price for beef tacos is $20 for two, so Tuesday is half-price!)

The dessert tiramizuc is homemade and also amazing, and the atmosphere is great. Draft beer, cocktails, and guacamole are all worth trying. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

Tip: On Tuesdays, you need to sit at the bar or high-top tables to get the half-price deal!",,862,2025-08-13T01:37:07.603Z,a month ago,0,43,True,"Hi Yuri, thank you so much for your fantastic review!

Food recommended were crispy rice for hot appetizer and yellowtail jalapeño for cold. Paired so well with house sake carafe!!!

Sushi and sashimi deluxe, soyu ramen (will try tonkotsu next time) nice umame with mushroom slight flared up taste even with chicken.

Topped them all was Kiki (sorry if I botched the spelling of your name) very caring and attentive.

Food is relatively fast. Plenty of bar seats after work gyoza, Asahi and ramen affordable as well as numbered rolls.

Crowd keeps on rolling in at 8-9pm. So, reservation recommended. Such a nice vista both from inside and outside.

Pricing is reasonable not crazy. $9 beer, quality entree in $20 range as well. Possibly partly why +4.5 rating holds up while some other Japanese restaurant nearby can't.

.
아이들과 함께 방문했는데, 돈가스가 없어서 아쉬웠지만 가라아게가 있어서 아쉬움을 달랠수 있었습니다. 롤도 하나 주문했고 우나기동도 주문했습니다. 이 두개는 완벽했습니다. 라멘은 미소라멘과 탄탄멘을 주문했는데 탄탄멘이 다른 종류가 나와서 아쉬웠습니다. 그래도 그냥 먹었습니다.
.
하지만 이 집의 특기가 라멘인 만큼 면발이 쫄깃하고 국물이 진해서 정말 좋았습니다. 롤이나 우나기동은 일본식이 아니라 미국에 잘 적응한 느낌이 더 강합니다. 삿뽀로도 병맥주로 팔고 있어서 좋았습니다. 교자도 생각보다 괜찮았고 가라아게도 평균이상은 했습니다. 시간이 되면 재방문할 의사가 있는 맛집입니다.","I made a reservation and visited on a pleasant Friday evening. I didn't have anything special to do in the area, but I stopped by after a walk to Vessel. The exhibition hall is nearby, but it wasn't too far from Vessel.

I visited with my kids, and while I was disappointed they didn't have tonkatsu, they did have karaage, which made up for it. I ordered a roll and an unagi-don (uncooked unagi), both of which were perfect. I ordered miso ramen and tantanmen (spicy tantanmen), but was disappointed that they served two different tantanmen. Still, I ate it anyway.

However, as this restaurant specializes in ramen, the noodles were chewy and the broth was rich, which was really good. The rolls and unagi-don felt more like American fare than Japanese. I was also happy that they also serve Sapporo beer in bottles. The gyoza were better than I expected, and the karaage was above average.

Suram NYC in Hell’s Kitchen is a no-fuss sushi and ramen spot that delivers exactly what you expect. We stopped in for a quick dinner and kicked things off with a couple of sushi rolls—fresh, straightforward, and just right for an appetizer.

For mains, we each went with ramen built on their creamy twelve-hour chicken stock, topped with chicken chashu, egg, mushroom, naruto, scallion, and edamame. The broth was rich enough to satisfy but not something that lingers in your memory—comforting, though not particularly standout.

The restaurant itself has a clean, minimalist look, with a vibe that leans toward Japanese-style dining but softened with an American twist. Service was polite, a little brisk, and seemed intent on keeping the evening moving along. Prices felt fair and very much in line with what you’d expect for this type of casual NYC spot.

All in all, Suram NYC is a decent choice when you’re in the neighborhood and craving sushi and ramen. It won’t blow you away, but it hits the mark for a reliable, uncomplicated meal.

We're genuinely sorry to hear about your experience. It's important to us that all guests feel welcome.
However, I am offended that you think you were discriminated against, we are very proud of the fact that we have a very diverse staff (as a matter of fact the waitress who served is Eastern European, the Busser is from Bangladesh, the cooks are from Ecuador and the dishwashers are from Mexico). So, it is kind of “Racist” for you to accuse us of Discrimination because of your ethnicity.
I am sorry you did not like the food you ordered, as a note you had ample time to tell someone on our wait staff we would have taken any measure to get it right either by redoing the dish or replacing it with something else. The one thing we can’t do is read your mind. You told the wait staff you were not pleased after you finished your meal. 
Incidentally $9.00 for a bottle of a 750ml of Premium Water in a Steakhouse is not overpriced. West Side Steakhouse has been referred to as a reasonably priced steakhouse on many, many occasions. I am sorry our prices do not fit your budget but to write a 1-Star review was just totally mean spirited and I think you should really remove it.
When you go to social media you should realize that your words have consequences. This restaurant employes 14 full and part-time employees. Many are the very type of people you pretend to champion, people that work very hard to provide for their families. It’s looks to me like you want us to go out of business and my employees to lose their jobs.
I don’t know if you feel empowered or if you think you are entitled to say whatever you want, whenever you want to, but civilized people put thought behind their words.
So let me give you some words to think about, “Karma knows everyone, and it never forgets where you live”.

For drinks, I chose a Thai iced tea, and the very first sip completely blew me away. To finish, I ordered a coconut cake for dessert. I couldn’t even wait to take a picture before digging in—it was that tempting! The cake was full of rich coconut aroma and flavor.

Naturally, I had to pick her brain on where the best Brazilian food in Manhattan was, and the only place she would really hang her hat on was Rice X Beans in Hells Kitchen.

A year later, I cashed in this mental note and made the push to the intersection of 10th Ave and 48th street with my big bro.

We sat down and were greeted by our server who had a strong Brazilian accent, which got me excited. It screamed authenticity. It’s crazy how a simple accent from a server can send me from Manhattan straight to a small restaurant in Rio.

We scanned the menu and I thought it was interesting how there seemed to be a strong Caribbean influence, as there were empanadas and sweet plantains… but a quick google search tells me that plantains are originally from Southeast Asia and Empanadas originated in Spain. The more I learn about the world, the more I realize I truly know nothing.

We went with 4 empanadas (2 beef and 2 chicken), BBQ ribs ($16), the Picanha for 2 ($70), and a side of plantains.

The empanadas were sensational, but in hindsight we should have just got 4 beef as they were much more flavorful than the chicken. Hindsight is always 20/20 though.

The ribs were the only real miss of the meal, as they were just a bit bland and served luke warm, which concerned me for the main event that was the Picanha.

However, when that Picanha came I knew we were in good hands. An enormous portion of the iconic Brazilian style top sirloin that came with fries, farofa, rice, beans, and a side salad. It was so much food that it barely fit on our table for 2. A beautiful site.

This steak was perfectly medium rare, well seasoned, and had a rich, beefy flavor with a buttery melt-in-your-mouth fat cap. The sides were an ideal pairing with this cut of steak, with the rice and plantains being the standouts. This was almost like a jasmine rice where you could taste each individual grain, and had a subtle garlic and onion flavor.

These plantains were some of the best I’ve had in the city, as they were carmelized with a soft and tender texture. They taste even better than they looked which is saying A LOT.

I sound like a broken record at this point, but it always amazes me how in New York, you can get a high level of any cuisine from across this beautiful planet. Also, shoutout to my former coworker for the rec. You can learn something from everyone.

Dear Hasalon team,

My friend and I came in with the excitement of trying out as many dishes as we could, but unfortunately, we encountered a frustrating experience.
We had some difficulty understanding the menu, and we ended up ordering the Shawarma dish and the Wagyu steak dish. However, we were served two dishes that looked very similar — not what we were expecting or hoping for. When we kindly tried to return the second dish, the manager insisted we keep it and told us, “What would you do if you had a restaurant?”
This interaction made us feel very uncomfortable, and honestly, it took away our appetite and desire to stay and enjoy the rest of the meal.
We wanted to share this feedback in the hope that future guests might have a better, more respectful experience.",,837,2025-07-18T03:20:17.420Z,2 months ago,0,5,False,,,

My friend and I went out to eat at this restaurant and we wanted to enjoy the atmosphere and the food.

The manager of the place arrived!! He put the dish back on the table for us!! He has a defensive and aggressive attitude and tells us what the problem is?? We explain to him that this is not the dish we expected and he starts saying that it is our problem and it is our fault that we did not understand the dish and forced us to eat it!! He left the table and we were shocked!! I asked another waiter to take the dish from the table because we were looking at it and saying we don't want this dish, please take it away. The manager came back again and this time was even more angry!! He kept accusing us that it was our problem that we didn't understand the dish and when I saw her yelling at my friend and trying to embarrass her for the misunderstanding I asked him why he was so hard on customers?? Everything is fine.. He just looked me in the eye, made a face and said ""fine"". And left. The truth is that we no longer had any appetite left to eat the rest of the dishes. He really ruined our mood.. We really have no problem paying the bill but wow, it's not about the money, it's just about this shocking service. I hope you read this and learn from it.

We came to HaSalon as a group of five, expecting a fun night with good food and drinks. What we got instead was a frustrating and disappointing experience that felt more like a scam than a high-end dining experience.

We weren’t very hungry, so we ordered a few dishes (3–4 total) and a bottle of wine, thinking we’d enjoy a light meal and focus more on drinks. Shortly after, our waitress came over and told us there’s a minimum spend of $100 per person – on food only. We were surprised. We politely explained that we weren’t here to eat heavily, just to enjoy the vibe and have drinks. But she insisted, saying it’s policy and there’s no way around it.

We asked to speak with the manager, who offered to “help” by creating a menu that would meet the $100 per person food minimum – that’s $500 total, not including alcohol. Not ideal, but we went along with it just to salvage the night.

At the end of the night, the bill came to over $1,000, including just $200 worth of drinks, meaning we had been forced to spend way more on mediocre food. To top it off, they automatically added a 20% tip per person, which felt outrageous given the experience.

The food? Mostly average. A couple of dishes were borderline flavorless, and only the steak stood out as truly good. Everything else was forgettable or disappointing. For the price and pressure, this felt less like a fine dining experience and more like a money grab.

Between the hidden minimums, the aggressive upselling, and the mediocre food, HaSalon was a complete letdown. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone – there are far better places to spend your money and enjoy yourself in NYC.",,1722,2025-06-13T14:27:11.081Z,3 months ago,0,4,False,,,

We eat dinner in NYC all the time — if you charge like $50 for small apps, I have certain expectations, and they are not met when it’s 1/2 of a potato with sour cream. The portions were comically small, and we were starving despite ordering more than what the waitress recommended. Ended up getting pizza across the street after. Good pizza, but that’s sad after you’ve spent a few bills per person at a restaurant. The cocktails were good and the wine list had very good options. I got the feeling that the food isn’t really their “thing” — it’s like a cover charge for groups of people to come and get drunk and dance, around others who can afford it. People were getting up on the tables and chairs and dancing, after the evening reached a certain point. It was a pretty fun experience, especially if you don’t expect it.

We started with the Carpaccio di Angus, which was fresh and delicious, topped with arugula, asparagus, and Parmigiano. For the main course, I had the Filetto di Salmone—perfectly cooked salmon with a rich butter-lemon sauce, cauliflower puree, and grilled asparagus. My boyfriend had the Pappardelle al Ragu di Salsiccia, and he was thoroughly impressed with the pasta.

We finished with a creamy dessert that was the perfect way to end the meal. The portions were generous, and the prices were more than reasonable for the quality of the food. Service was top-notch—attentive and friendly. Highly recommend, and we’ll definitely be back!",,793,2025-03-12T18:23:55.585Z,6 months ago,0,38,True,,,

From the moment we started planning the event to the evening itself, the proprietors, Lino and Gregory, went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect.

The ambiance of Il Melograno is both cozy and chic, providing the ideal backdrop for a memorable evening with friends. We opted for a pre-fixe menu, which was expertly curated to cater to a variety of dietary preferences, including vegetarian and pescatarian options. Each dish, from the shared appetizers to the delectable desserts, was beautifully presented and delicious.

What truly set this experience apart was the exceptional service. Lino and Gregory’s attention to detail, accommodating nature, and warm hospitality made us feel truly special. They even surprised me with a stunning bouquet – a gesture that touched my heart deeply.

For anyone looking for a venue that offers not only exquisite Italian cuisine but also personalized and caring service, Il Melograno is the place to go. I am already looking forward to my next visit!

Thank you, Lino and Gregory, for making my 40th birthday an evening to remember. I cannot recommend Il Melograno highly enough!",,1241,2025-02-27T20:44:01.790Z,7 months ago,0,5,False,,,

We recently made a reservation for dinner and have returned 5 times since.  We love this restaurant. The food, the service and atmosphere are all top notch. My husband and I highly recommend the salmon, swordfish, stripped bass (a special), the pork chop, the chicken Milanese, the veal ravioli - in short everything we ordered was prepared with great care for flavor and balance.  The salads, soups and appetizers are all varied enough with daily specials to choose from to make repeat visits a must.  The service is friendly and meals delivered hot from the kitchen.  We’ve noticed that several early guests chose this restaurant before going to the theatre which is a few blocks east.

We only wish we’d found il melagrano sooner.
